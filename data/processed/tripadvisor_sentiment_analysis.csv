From here, our tour guide IZZZ took us around the park for 5 hours. It was incredible. He told us about all the attractions before we went on them, we got straight through all the lines including show lines and even had our own private air-conditioned room at the waterworld show. We all got $25 food and drink vouchers to spend and 10% off merchandise around the park. It was truly one amazing experience and 110% worth the money.

В целом, я шел туда с одной целью, посетить шоу по мотивам фильма Водный мир. Оно действительно достойное, проходит 2 раза в день, и я сходил оба раза,и совсем не пожалел. Спецэффекты, каскадеры, пиротехника, водные гонки, актерская игра, все присутствует, такого я еще не видел ни в одном парке. 

Пока между этими шоу было время, глянул один аттракцион, вроде его ставил Спилберг, называется свет, камера, мотор! Очень рекомендую, там ты просто стоишь и наблюдаешь за голливудскими декорациями и спецэффектами наяву.

На аттракционах в этот раз я решил не кататься, был всего один день на сентозе, и очень хотелось посмотреть многое другое, и везде успеть. В парке провел около 4х часов, немного успел погулять, декорации конечно в диснее поинтереснее. Вход стоил около 80 баксов, очереди на входе не было, что меня сильно удивило, но я пришел и не с открытия парка.",Водный мир,2024-03-01,SOLO,Юрий,"Vladivostok, Russia",Vladivostok,Russia,1

This was our second visit to the Lion City and we had seen most of the big landmarks before and since it had been a number of years since we had been to a major theme park, we thought, hey why not. 

The admission price is quite reasonable especially when compared to Universal Studios in Los Angeles or Orlando. However, admission is about all that gets you. You won't be able to ride many rides unless you fork over an extra $120 SGD for a fast pass. In mid afternoon, the wait for all the major rides was over 2 hours. Sorry, but I'm not standing out in the hot sun for 2+ hours for a 3 minute ride.  As a result, we got in only 4 rides (none major) during our 7 hour stay.

Although expensive I’d say the Universal Express pass is really an essential if you want to ride on all the good stuff…..we reckon without those passes we would have managed 2-3 rides at best as some of the queues were c90 minutes (longest we queued was probably 10 minutes).
The water ride in Jurassic Park is great fun but atleast one person on each tube will likely get absolutely soaked (in our case me!) so a good idea to keep that one until the back end of the day unless you like feeling damp!

We Managed to get on all four rides that were open to us with our passes and even got a second go on Transformers, before eating breakfast (which was very nice) and getting over to the temporary barrier to allow us into the rest of the theme park at 10am. This gave us time to grab a locker and get onto the Mummy Returns before the queues began. 

Sadly, the Battle Star Galactica Cylon was closed down whilst we were in the queue and didn’t reopen whilst we were there but that didn’t hinder our fun as we got on all of the other rides (bar one) without having to queue longer than 50 minutes. I’m so pleased we bought the Rise and Dine tickets though as I don’t think we would have gotten into nearly as many rides if we’d entered the park at ten o’clock and would have been queuing much longer. 

Tip - the rapids ride does leave you completely soaked to the skin - more so than any other rapids ride I have ever been on. To be fair though they do have vending machines all along the sides where we were queuing but being northerners (England) we just thought people were going OTT - turns out they weren’t!

Luckily for us, there was a drying machine just outside the ride and together with the heat and sun we were almost dry by the time we left the theme park later that day - although trainers were still damp!

Do visit early in the morning when it opens to give you maximum time to explore the park. Some of the best rides which we liked are:, the transformers, revenge of the mummy, lost world rapids, in addition to the roller coaster rides in transformer zone.

They had a wonderful time and this was the highlight of their trip. However, I have visited the location in California, and this is certainly nothing like it. The California one has a train that goes around the studio, and the shows are amazing. The shows at the Singapore one weren't that great. I did not like the Stephen Spielberg one at all. The wait was long, it was extremely hot and the fans do not rotate so you are left waiting. Then when you enter there is a long boring talk, then you go to another room where they show special effects. It pales in comparison because at the LA one you have a proper show. Waterworld lines were very long so we skipped that since it was so hot too. The food was okay, barely any place to sit since all the tables were fully occupied.
Express costs a lot of money - with the ticket prices plus SGD 120 per person for express, we spent almost SGD 600 for 3 people. They nickel and dime a lot. The drying pods outside the water rapids ride cost SGD 5. The ponchos cost SGD 6. After paying such a hefty fee, you don't expect them to nickel and dime so much. My kids had a lot of fun and that was the point, but if you have been to the LA one, this one really doesn't measure up. You have to get express during peak time. Lines had 60-90 minutes wait for Battlestar Galactica and the like, and with express you basically are in and out in 10-15 minutes. When we saw the long lines we were so grateful for express even though it was so expensive. Within 4-5 hours we were done with all our rides and a couple of shows. Shrek 4-D was good but the talk before they open the doors was awful, just awful. It is long, unnecessary, everyone is just standing around waiting, kids are losing patience, and nobody is listening to the lady giving instructions and repeatedly asking people to move.

The incident occurred at the ""Human"" ride, where my brother and I, both holding express tickets, naturally skipped the queue and proceeded to the front. The attendant, whose name I believe was Razak, insisted on seeing our tickets again, despite us having already shown them at the entrance. After complying, I politely inquired if he was going to ask for tickets from those behind us, who happened to be locals or Chinese. He did not.

I intended to let the matter drop, but Razak kept pressing, asking, ""What did I do wrong?"" This unnecessary persistence was quite upsetting. Matters escalated when a young Singaporean girl, claiming to work there, but in a different queue, began hurling profanities (F word) at us. Instead of addressing her behavior, the attendant asked us to calm down. Naturally, I defended myself.

It's crucial for the staff at such esteemed attractions to recognize that Indians visit Singapore to spend generously, purchasing premium tickets and shopping extensively. Our time is valuable, and any irritation on their part needs a reality check.

By the time we got our bearings, the first ride I went on was Transformers. Went through the single rider queue and literally walked straight to the front (Apparently, the normal queue had a bit of a wait though). Went for a bite to eat and by the end was already 4.00pm so with not much time in the park I looked online which rides were the ""unmissable"" ones. Waited for my opportunity to ride Jurassic Park, Revenge of the Mummy and Battlestar Galactica. Was almost 5pm when I rode in order The Mummy (15mins wait), Jurassic Park (20m wait), Battlestar Galactica (15m cylon, 30m human). Of these, Jurassic park was probably the least worthy of a wait. Spent the ride spinning round anxious I'd start to feel naseous, only for a couple of semi-exciting drops before the ride end. 

Obviously, given more time we would have tried to experience a few shows as well but with a big family including children it was difficult to make it for the specific times. We did catch the trolls show which is cleverly scheduled as the last show of the day and located at the exit of the park. 

I was surprised by the lack of queues at the rides and dismissed it as the period possibly being low season. It could also be that I queued so late in the day. Luckily, didn't purchase the express pass. I would have been livid. I imagine if we entered at park opening the queues would have been much longer but by an hour before closing most people were exhausted and had already left.

0,947330608,2024-04-18,OTHER,2,"Universal Studios Singapore, nestled within the vibrant resort island of Sentosa, undoubtedly boasts a picturesque environment that mesmerizes visitors from the moment they step foot onto its grounds. However, this visual appeal is overshadowed by a glaring issue: the pervasive lack of adequate information regarding its events and attractions.

Yet, despite the allure of its setting, the park falls short in communicating vital information to its patrons, particularly concerning its events and attractions. This deficiency becomes painfully evident upon entering the park, as visitors are confronted with a plethora of high-level rides and attractions without prior knowledge or understanding. This lack of pre-visit information undermines the visitor experience and potentially leads to disappointment and frustration.

The absence of comprehensive event details prior to entry represents a significant oversight on the part of Universal Studios Singapore's management. Prospective guests are left uninformed about the nature of the park's offerings, including the intensity of rides, age suitability, and any potential restrictions or advisories. This not only hampers visitors' ability to make informed decisions but also poses safety concerns, particularly for families with young children or individuals with medical conditions.

Furthermore, the lack of upfront information can result in an unpleasant surprise for guests upon discovering that certain attractions may not align with their preferences or physical capabilities. This creates a sense of disillusionment and detracts from the overall enjoyment of the park experience.

Moreover, the absence of pre-visit event information undermines the value proposition for guests. Without prior knowledge of what to expect, visitors may question the justification for the steep entry fees associated with Universal Studios Singapore. A transparent and informative approach to communicating event details would not only enhance the visitor experience but also foster a sense of trust and goodwill towards the park.

In conclusion, while Universal Studios Singapore undoubtedly excels in providing a visually stunning and immersive environment, its failure to adequately inform guests about its events and attractions represents a significant shortcoming. The lack of pre-visit information detracts from the overall visitor experience, undermines safety considerations, and diminishes the value proposition for patrons.

We had an early entry so convinced the family to get up and spent 15 SGD on a ride from our hotel (Sofitel) . We were in seamlessly by 09h30 so raced up to do the popular rides (river rapids and the Mummy). Having bought express passes, I was worried that I might have wasted money as the park was very quiet so we were whizzing through the rides. However, by 11h00 queues had started to build and by 13h00 the biggest rides had 60 min waiting times. I can't imagine how busy this would be during school hols.

My advice - get there early, do as many rides as you can. Take a break and then use your express pass to have a second go. See the Waterworld show, it is good, silly fun and you get a sit down. It is SO hot, so you can't race about from ride to ride. Take it easy and hydrate!

Of all the attractions, The Battlestar Galactica: CYLON is our favorite, an adrenaline-pumping roller coaster that transported us to another dimension with its speed and thrills.

0,944329626,2024-03-28,OTHER,1,"It was horrible for the following reasons:

A cheap imitation of Disneyland:

They try to imitate Disneyland or Disneyland Sea in Japan very poorly.

I saw 1 popcorn stand like Disneyland but no special themed box to be sold at the side, no special flavours and only had 1 stand whereas Disney has loads.

Some rides show wait time others don't...Disney shows it for all.

They give you free lockers if your bags fall from rides and hurt someone. Then charge you to use lockers when rides will get you wet. (just have one policy universal studio). Disney had areas to store your bags on the rides.

Food and Drinks:
I didn't have time for food but saw curries on a menu there. Disneyland's food menu was themed for each area so it made it a little more special.

Drinks were normal cans of soda for a high price. Nothing was branded, unlike Disney which even if they sold drinks that were available in Japan the drink sold in the park had a Disney logo there.

Positives:
Transformers and Jurassic Park ride is good.

Street Parades / Dance:
Like Disney, they try to show a few events but it isn't themed.

Queues:
So as you wait to be let into shows, people shove you and push you aside like you're in a street market and everything is on discount. No regard for health or safety. 

Price wise:
Similar price to Disneyland and you get way more in Disneyland than here. On the ride into the park copies the same ideas as Disneyland as well, the American happy voice to say ""it's gonna be magic"". And again, the staff waved to you like Disneyland but I noticed it doesn't always happen. On the way back the tram was packed like a London Underground. 

Staff:
Only saw a few staff that smiled and looked happy. Most seemed to dislike their jobs I guess.

Park Closing Time:
7 pm is a closing time you are hurried out like vermin. Disneyland is at 10 pm when you are asked to leave pleasantly.

2,935882772,2024-01-28,OTHER,4,"My wife and I spent a fun day in December 2023 at Universal Studios Singapore. I purchased the special festive tickets ahead of our holiday which included a regular day ticket, meal deal and S$5 retail voucher. We travelled there via the Cable Car from Harbourfront (where our cruise ship was docked) although we realised  after the journey that it wasn't the easiest way to get to Universal Studios and certainly wasn't the cheapest travel option. Recommended route would be the MRT or walking via the boardwalk.

There are six zones in the park and each one houses a small handful of rides and attractions...there are six roller coasters in total (which was my main reason for visiting) and the biggest was Battlestar Galactica (which is actually two separate roller coasters that interact with each other - Human and Cyclon). Cyclon is an intense inverted coaster with five inversions, and Human is a conventional roller coaster and more family-friendly, although both tracks feature a launched lifthill which gives a great punch to the start of the ride).

The other 'big' roller coaster is Revenge of the Mummy - an enclosed coaster which features three launches and a dark ride section. Rode this a couple of times as the queue was short. The remaining coasters are more family friendly...Canopy Flyer and Puss in Boots are both suspended coasters that hang under the track and Enchanted Airways is a fun compact steel family coaster. As well as the roller coasters, I must mention the excellent Transformers The Ride 3D attraction and the fun family friendly Sesame Street Spaghetti Space Chase ride. We also enjoyed the Shrek 4D theatre, which was the same as one we had done elsewhere but a lot of laughs.

It plans to think ahead in terms of ride order, as we found the big rides and roller coasters were quiet first thing (short queues between 5 and 20 minutes) and also later in the day the queues were short, but in contrast, an hour after park opening most of the big rides had queues of around an hour or so. We also visited on a Thursday which was reasonably quiet compared to peak days and weekends. 

Some of the rides had single rider queues (SRQ) to ensure the trains went out without empty seats although on Canopy Flyer the SRQ was roped off and the staff told me it was closed so I gave up attempting to ride it again as the queue was 50 minutes. The park also do not permit any on-ride photography on the roller coasters, even with secured GoPro cameras on official harnesses. This isn't a safety issue and secured GoPro cameras are permitted at many parks around the works such as Busch Gardens and SeaWorld parks. The Battlestar Galactica coaster also has x-ray machines at the entrance and staff using paddles to check you have no cameras in your pockets, which is totally understandable for loose articles but annoying when the GoPro cameras are secured and totally safe. 

Overall we had a great day, rode all the attractions and roller coasters that we wanted to ride, and enjoyed our festive meal deal lunch. The park is flat and easy to navigate, has plenty of shady areas, although not a massive number of places to sit down near the coasters. The theming is top quality as you would expect from Universal.

As a tourist experience though, you'll be hard-pressed to have a good time, and you'll feel robbed given how much it costs. Simply put - they let too many people in at a time. I waited 1-2 hours for rides, and it just kills any fun you're planning on having (especially when some of the rides go for less than one minute). They have expensive 'express passes', but these are kinda classist rubbish and undermine the whole concept of queuing in the first place.  

I think the Jurassic Park rapids ride is one of the best, but bring spare shoes and clothes because you will get soaked. I also enjoyed 'Lights, Camera, Action', and the Waterworld show. 

Despite the high entry cost, the park has several microtransactions; $5 to borrow a poncho, $5 to use a drying pod, etc. Feels pretty greedy given how much you pay to enter the park. 

One thing to check is the weather forecast - any lightning at all and they'll close all the outdoor rides. Good luck doing anything indoors - once the outdoor areas were closed, all the indoors activities had queues stretching out into the pathways and there were no seats to be found at any of the cafes.

We were a family of 6, my parents ( aged 73 / 67 ), us ( 44/39) & my 2 kids ( 14/10). The reasons for taking the VIP tour were as follows:
1. My father had a health issue that made walking/ standing at length a problem.
2. I wanted my parents to enjoy the rides with my kids
3. We had come during the Christmas week & place would be super crowded.
4. The resorts at Sentosa were priced very high making even a 2 day stay prohibitvely expensive.

The best compromise was a VIP Tour & Joan who was our guide deftly handled the way to cover the entire park in under 6 hours ( 5 hrs + 1 hr lunch break)

The VIP pass entitles you to get a free buggy for the kid(s) & an e-scooter at 50% discount , which we availed .

We were at the VIP lounge @ 10am. Our tour started at 11. Used the hour to freshen up...drink some coffee served & getting anxious looking at all the crowd passing by us thinking that we will have to be in some amount of queues....

None of that happened....Joan took us to the rides with wait time = 0 & direct lifts to rides so that my dad didnt have to use stairs...We covered almost 10 rides & 4 shows in that period which is impossible even with an express pass. Seats with best views at shows were blocked & lines were avoided making the whole experience an absolute worth the 430 SGD/ ticket that was paid for super peak times.

Photo opportunity were made exclusively / first in line for us which made the kids super excited. 

I would suggest anyone with a limited time frame to use the VIP pass. The other advantage is that after the tour gets over , you can continue to use the VIP pass as an express ticket too. So yes, the rides can be taken for the 2nd time but after the tour is over with a little wait depending upon the crowd.

Even with a pre-booked ticket, I would suggest you get here slightly earlier than opening time to a get a place in the queue and get a jump over other visitors. The park isn’t as large as the American version in LA or Orlando but you still need to plan accordingly. I also suggest downloading the app before you get there as it will have the map on it as well as wait times for each ride. Don’t take the wait times as gospel though as it can be wrong as one ride I checked was as low as 5 minutes when it showed as 50 minutes at the ride. It is generally reliable though.

The park is broken down by themes and there were lots of rides that are suitable for young and old as well as the more adventurous. There were not as many single rider queues as I thought there would be as I don’t really enjoy roller coasters whereas my sister loves them. I really enjoyed the 3D/4D rides the best. Shrek 4D was fun but Transformers The Ride was the best that we rode that a few times. I enjoyed the live show of Waterworld. Word of warning is that you will get wet if you sit in the splash zones. Another place where you will get drenched is the Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure. It is the luck of the draw if only your shoes get wet or you get a total soaking!

Lots of places to grab a bite to eat or drink. Plenty of places to buy souvenirs. There were a few places you can get pictures with the characters but didn’t really have time for that. 

The park may not be the largest but we spent the whole day here so you need to manage your queuing time. We didn’t eat anything here (which helped saved costs) nor did we buy any souvenirs. Just bought drinks to stay hydrated as it does get hot so make sure get shade by doing indoor rides or shows and avoid any rain in there too.

1,923517440,2023-10-29,OTHER,4,"This was my first time at a US theme park outside of Florida. I was quite interested to try out USS, due to the unique attractions it offers but also some more familiar. The Mummy is an exceptional ride and just as great here in Singapore as when I first rode it in Florida in 2006. Nice to re-live the memories. The Shrek area is well themed with enjoyable rides. Jurassic Park feels a little more limited than the Florida version but its different enough to make it worth trying. Battlestar Galactica and Transformers are also great rides too. 

Was I nervous about visiting USS after reading the reviews on here? Absolutely. You must plan ahead and must be prepared to do things differently. I downloaded the USS app weeks in advance to monitor queue patterns on different days. What did this tell me? Well, most people do the first ride they see near the entrance, pushing queue times up to 90+ minutes within the first half an hour of opening. So we walked to the other end of the park (doesn't take long, it's a small theme park) and managed to do 5 rides within the first 45 minutes. We went back to Transformers near the entrance later in the day as it became quieter due to the morning rush making it's way to Puss in Boots by mid afternoon. 

So, top tips if you want to have a great time; 
1. Get there at opening time, they even let you in before the posted opening time, so you can get to your first ride bang on time
2. Don't waste time with selfies etc at the entrance, do that later if you must. 
3. Go to the furthest end of the theme park and start with those rides.
4. Go on a weekday. 

If you follow the above tips, chances are you won't need an Express Pass. We bought one based on the negative reviews here and only used it towards the end of the day to squeeze in as many rides as possible. Our final tally was 21 rides in 7 hours (4 times on the Mummy!).  We had a great day for rides. 

Finally, I've scored 4 stars instead of 5 ... well, the food at Friars in the Shrek area was pretty bad. The only negative in an otherwise great day.",Decent theme park but plan ahead,2023-10-01,COUPLES,Stephen B,"Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom",Newcastle upon Tyne,United Kingdom,0

We especially like the utilisation of a single riders line to fill up empty spaces on rides.

The biggest downside was the fact that all attractions shut at 5pm, and the rest of the theme park shortly after that.

That's assuming visitors turn up right as gates open and leave right as gates close. And we haven't even considered waiting in the long queues, time for eating/resting, souvenier shopping, ride delays from adverse weather etc. It's simply not enough time (especially without the pricey express pass).

3,916794686,2023-09-16,OTHER,3,"Many years ago I visited both Universal Studios parks in the U.S. and I first expected this to be similar, then I read some reviews so I did what I usually do and went there without any expectation. I think if you have ever visited the American ones, this is mandatory to avoid disappointment. If you haven't visited the parks in the U.S., I think it is easier to totally enjoy this one.

I was a bit afraid of the long queues, since most reviewers wrote about that but I was super lucky and basically never had to wait in line except for once when I had to wait for 40 minutes to go on the Jurassic Park river attraction, which is totally okay. It was a Thursday and I skipped the sci-fi part because I can't do those attractions for health reasons, but when I walked passed them I saw there weren't really long queues (just in case, there is the pass to skip the queues but, of course, it is pretty expensive and I didn't buy it).

The staff generally speaks good English. Some staff members are really nice while others average or not too much in the mood for a theme park. The attractions were okay (Shrek 4 and the Pantages theatre were closed, they told me about which attractions would be closed when I redeemed my ticket from GetYourGuide and they also said in case of rain all outdoor attractions would shut down). The Jurassic Park rapids are not even close to those in America but they are nice. I can say the majority of the attractions were okay, nothing really cool. I had the feeling like the whole park was just pretending. I mean, I know Minions and Jurassic Park's dinosaurs etc. are not real, but I am paying to believe they are. Also, for being a theme park about movies, the only attraction which tackles the topic (like how movies are filmed etc.) is the one narrated by Steven Spielberg, which was nice, but I think putting (fake, of course) handprints on the ground to resemble the Walk of Fame or the sign ""Hollywood"" is not enough to make people believe the park has something to do with the movie industry.

The park looked a little run down, as I said, like they didn't make much effort to create locations and rides which looked intriguing and as if you'd actually ended up inside Jurassic Park or whatever. I didn't like the shows much as well. Poor acting and it was like the cast members were trying too hard to have fun and to get the audience involved but I have a bit of background in the creative sector and I think the majority of people would enjoy their acts (as it seemed from the crowd). 

All in all, I'd rate this park 3 out of 5. I think it shouldn't be branded as a Universal Studios one, then it could stand on its own and be okay but the comparison with the others Universal Studios parks is often inevitable and this park reminded me more of an Italian theme park (I am originally from Italy) than a proper, Universal Studios branded park which should be about allowing you to go ""inside"" movies and experience something magical/full of adrenaline.

I'd say go if, like me, you don't have expectations and you're in the mood for an easy day out, as when you go to the fair. If you have young kids, I think they will love it. The prices for drinks and foods are high, I only bought an ice-cream and then ate and drank the things I brought along (nobody checked that).

Unfortunately Transformers ride was closed for maintenance for the whole day. We went to the park on Thursday, outside of any Singapore holidays, but queues were still pretty long during the day, 30-60 minutes (even on some family rides). There are two reasons in my opinion:
Firstly staff were really slow, especially at Battlestar Galactica.
Secondly, the park's policy seems to be pushing fast track tickets. Sometimes they filled up the entire train with fast trackers, sometimes they took only a few people from regular queue, so we waited almost an hour for Human track, despite queue wasn't long.
Surprisingly the Cyclon (more intense) track was not much in demand and real waiting time there was about 10-20 minutes throughout the whole day (which we exploited after we found out about it to fulfill riding eagerness).
Also the park forces people to use lockers outside of rides to store personal things, instead of leaving them on shelves at the ride platform. They are strict and even scanning everyone with metal detector each time at the Battlestar Galactica.

So first off, it's pricey. There are not many rides and even when we went in off peak, lines for the basic rides were over 60 minutes. They closed rides down after 2pm as the queues for long enough for closing time

If you are going to go, you need that vip pass. It's a pay to play theme park with even the shows taking an hour plus to line up for. Honestly don't bother unless you have a pass to skip the queues. 

We could only fit in 2 rides with the queues, it's $100 to get in as well. It's not worth doing with the standard pass

We waited in line for Jurassic world 90 mins when the wait time on the app says 50. The reason this happened is they block of the ride for the line jumpers. I was counting around 6 rafts at a time had no people from the normal line in it. So add another 50% time to what they say the wait times are.

Half the water fountains don't work, that's rough when it's 36 degrees. Lined up over an hour, so thirsty and the water fountain was not far off. But it's broken so that's too bad.

If you are elderly or want to bring elderly along, re think and check the weather. With a serious lack of water facilities working, monster queues of 30 min to buy drinks and not much shade or rest spots, this could turn into a serious situation quick. 

The final thing I saw that just made me I'll was a man who absolutely slapped the hell out of his daughter. I'm not sure where discipline and assualt change in this country, but that assault on a child was disgraceful. It would've thrown me off balance and I'm not a small man.

No way you can call a place like this family friendly when this behaviour is allowed. Surely there is a way to implement a non violent disciplinary legislation in the park. I get that smacks and punishment are allowed here, but it's not like that in every country. A child seeing another getting absolutely flogged like what I saw at Universal is sickening and can't be good for them.

The day came closer and closer and the kids were thrilled to go. That day around 12pm (we visited the Sea Aquarium first) we arrived at USS and everything went smooth at the entrance. We decided to rent a stroller for the kids. There were about 5 customers in front of us and it took about a total of 45(!) minutes queueing in the heat before it was our turn. Way too long for just a stroller rental place. 

Finally we could start our USS trip, it was a weekday (Wednesday) and it was sooo crowded and there were queues everywhere. The estimating waiting times were from 60 minutes for the simple rides to 120(!) minutes for the rollercoasters. This is absolute crazy, queueing that long for a 3 minute ride. 

We decided to give it a shot anyways and started to queue at the Dino Soarin (Jurassic World). After about 45 minutes, we were about halfway the queue. The kids lost their patience and we decided to leave the queue. We went through the park for about an other 30 minutes, but there were queues everywhere, therefore we decided to leave the park.

The Positives

(1) Most of the staff are nice, some have you might find not so happy face expression, that is because of their culture. Unlike other parts of the world where you can tell they are happy and welcoming, here they have the same intensions but they show it differently.

(2) Most rides are nice, old, but nice and brings back memories.

(3) We chose the day with the least possibility of rain, and the park was running smoothly that day without rain. If it rains then your day is cut short.

(4) It is best to go early to the park to enjoy the stores and take pictures of the nice views before the park opens. Once the park opens, you will utilize that time for the parks, shows and activities.

(5) You need to book your tickets in advance, you can’t just walk to the park and buy tickets there. You have to choose a specific date and number of visitors.

The Negatives

(1) I wanted to take pictures with my family using both my phone and the Park’s staff cameras, unfortunately they insist on using your phone the wrong way and make the picture no looking good and insisted on it so you would have to buy their photo. That made me change my mind about buying their photo one of the photos.

(2) The Characters stay for a limited time and are very few and the kine to take a photo with then is very long. A whole day and didn’t have a chance to take a single photo with the characters or else we will miss many rides and activities.

(3) If you have been to the parks in Hollywood and Orlando, then you won’t enjoy this one very much as it is way smaller then them with much fewer rides and activities.

(4) Food and Drinks are extremely expensive and the taste is bad. If it was expensive and tastes good I would understand.

(5) Park hours are short  11:00 - 06:00. You won’t have enough time to do everything in one day.

(6) The express ticket is only for one time use to each ride, you can’t use it twice on the same ride.

(7) You have to use third party websites to purchase tickets,  and most of the time you have to purchase express ticket from inside the park.

(8) Some rides don’t accept express ticket.

(9) Rides have very long lines, it could take up to 100 minutes to wait for one ride

We booked Express Passes in advance, having read the helpful Tripadvisor reviews. Whilst they were expensive, they were really worth it, given the lengthy wait times for certain rides (upto 3hrs), so I would absolutely recommend this, if you can afford it. On the issue of price, it's a theme park after all and so paying ridiculous amounts of money for food, drinks and gift shop items goes with the territory. Yes, you are going to be haemorrhaging money throughout your day but that's what you sign up for - I don't think it's possible to visit these places (incl Disney etc) on the cheap.

The rides themselves are fun. Most things were working. Staff were fine - not wonderful nor dreadful. Don't think you need more than a day, provided you get on all the rides you want. Having done it, I don't think we'll need to visit again.

I totally understand the recent poor reviews - expensive, too much queueing etc. Having to wait for hours in the Singapore heat for a 2-minute ride would test the patience of any of us. My advice would be - get those express passes and book them in advance - don't wait for the day you visit as they're likely to sell out.

Nos descargamos la app y estuvimos en la puerta a las 10:30 am, media hora antes de la apertura. ¡Había más gente que en la guerra! El día que nosotros estuvimos hubo colas de 120 minutos en algunas horas centrales del día. Nosotros íbamos mirando en la app los tiempos de espera, y logramos no hacer más de 70 minutos de cola (que ya es, porque los ratos que no estás con climatización te agotan el triple). Nos encantó la atracción de Transformers, Shreck y la acuática de Jurassic Park. A pesar de no descansar para comer, ni de ver ningún espectáculo, no nos dio tiempo a montar en todo. Alguna atracción, nos pareció demasiado corta. El horario es tan escueto, solo de 11 a 18 horas, y efectivamente, aunque no es un gran parque no te da tiempo a disfrutar de todo por las colas.
En conclusión, si se quiere disfrutar de este parque se hace obligatorio el pase express (mira que a mí me fastidia que según lo que pagues haya visitantes de primera y de segunda). Universal debería ampliar horario, tener más espectáculos y manejar el tema de las colas, ya que nuestra visita nos dejó un sabor agridulce.
Ahora, también he de decir que tiene algunas atracciones absolutamente ESPECTACULARES, y las tiendas son preciosísimas.

However, our teen son wanted to see what US Singapore is like or has to offer.  The opening time of 11am to until 6pm alone is a deal breaker for me.  As a theme park hopper myself, I know that's really not a lot of time to explore a theme park.  Worst, when we got inside, the wait time for the all rides were 1-3 hours!  How are we supposed to really get the most out of this park and our money?  So, what my teen did was to simply choose the big rides he wanted to go to.  He chose the MUMMY,  Transformer and The Cyclon vs Human ride (Battlestar Galactica) - which I might add that the Cyclon one was one of the best thrill-rides we've been to (Comparable to Six Flags thrill rides).  It's long, smooth and yeap, you can feel the G's!   I gave up the line on Human ride because it took a long time.  He ended up waiting 3 hours while me and my wife waited for him in the Oasis restaurant.  We had lunch in Oasis and parked ourselves there for the most part (while waiting for our teen).  It's air-conditioned and close to all the rides he wanted to go to.  The food in Oasis are Indian favorites.  They are flavorful and a good change from our usual western and Chinese Fares.  It was a super-hot day when we visited hence it was worth it to buy the refillable souvenir bottles for $14sgd.  To refill it with smoothies was just $5sgd and $3sgd for sodas all over the park.  We also sampled the turkey legs, corn in the cup and churros around the park and it was also delish.  The staff seems stiff... strict or not too friendly.  I am unsure if that is just their culture or am I missing something.  When you do ask them questions however, they will reply helpfully albeit abrupt.  We have travel to many different countries hence we don't let these differences bother us.  There were not rude after all, just not friendly in appearance.  No smile, no small talks, no extras.  Don't take it personally.  We just chucked it off as one of our experiences as a first timer in Singapore.  I believe my teen son had a good time here (even for a short time), esp. with the rides but I know we missed some big ones due to time constraints.

Due to the abuse faced by many guests (witnessed it first hand), the staff have a ""pek chek"" (aggravated) attitude and are generally curt and unmotivated.

The park is open from 11am-6pm daily, regardless if it's a weekend or weekday. However, halfway through the day, an unannounced power outage grappled the park, leaving only 4/11 attractions open. The staff did exceptionally well... at screwing up organisation and damage control. I witnessed some crew members being rude to park guests when all they asked was ""what's going on?"". A large group of people camped for 2 hours outside Transformers, clogging up the walkway. Other crew members had casual conversations with each other outside their respective attractions as if they were off duty, and some even dismissed complaints/queries from disgruntled guests with a wide grin. 

Once the power outage was gradually resolved around 4.30-5.30 (just as the park was near closing time), I felt like I had been cheated of my money. ""Ride the Movies"" they said, but they forgot to mention that the movie was ""The Room"".

Getting to the park on the cable car from Waterfront MRT was good fun, entering easy with limited queue.  My son is T1 diabetic so we queued to get fast passes as he’s allowed.  Disappointed they only allowed 2 when there were 4 of us visiting - in the UK it’s up to 5.  It had been raining a little, bit of thunder which isn’t unusual for this time of year.  However this meant they had closed the 2 largest rides (Human and Cyborg?) and everyone had moved to the Mummy, which was a 95 minute queue, the express queue no shorter than the normal one.  My sons went through nevertheless, and were out in 30 mins in the express queue.  Then they tried the Human rollercoaster which was a 40 min queue per the digital queue time notice.  One and a half hours later they got out (in the express queue).  This is vey dangerous for diabetics to be queuing for this long and quite stressful for us as parents.  We now couldn’t trust the ride wait time boards and it was about 3pm so we decided to complain and leave.

Generally this park has had no investment in years  ( I’ve been 3 times in 2015, 2019 and now 2023 and it’s exactly the same). They are using it to extract as much money as possible without caring at all for the customer experience, possibly before demolishing or redeveloping it I suspect.  Everywhere you look it looks tired and worn - it’s hands down the worst theme park I’ve been to for years now.

We demanded a full refund from Guests Services, first they said no refunds but after we demanded to see the manager they agreed it (not seen the money yet though). While we were waitjng to speak to the manager we also noted the poor approach to others too - this would not be tolerated in a European or US theme park.  One woman had lost her children and was told they had no way of making announcements, no protocol for dealing with lost kids and she just had to wait at the exit to spot them!

The chaos here starts before you even get there. Some space cadet designed the ""Sentosa Express Monorail"" with only 2 cars! So when you have 10s of thousands of people all trying to get there for the 11am open time (yes, you read that correctly, it's only open for 7 hours), it is very, very crowded and slow.

The Battlestar Galactica rides are awesome, but apart from that there isn't much else. We queued for over an hour for the Puss In Boots, only to almost fall asleep on the ride itself. 

Plus, unlike Disney Land/See in Tokyo, the lines are boring. Over an hour of just looking at boring walls. Doesn't have the same magic.

1) Заранее чтоб минимизировать стояние в очереди, купили билет в будний день и скоростные билеты Express. Стоят они очень дорого.
Добрались к парку к открытию и увидели стометровую очередь на вход в парк, но по экспресс билету вход отдельный, быстрый, но мы рано обрадовались, только зашли в парк, и нам пришлось встать в огромную очередь на выдачу браслетов для быстрой очереди.
В чем проблема была выдать этот браслет заранее при покупке билетов, непонятно. Наверное специально, чтоб люди не катались а стояли в безтолковых очередях. Там мы часа полтора и потратили.
Парк этот маленький, но внутри оказалось сотня тысяч человек. С экспресс билетами из них половина. Дерут такие деньги и запускают в парк столько народу. Совести нет.
И с этим экспресс билетом стоянка в очереди занимала от 40 мин до 2 часов.  К обеду мы прокатились только на 2х аттракционах.

Universal is an impressive park with many attractions but my 13 year old son was only interested in the rides.  We arrived at 11:00am opening and settled on Battle Star Galactica coasters.

This one is not for the faint hearted, very aggressive with loops, spirals and ample opportunities to look at sky past your feet.

It was disappointing that the some rides, food stalls, theatres, shows were not running.  We also found that a couple of rides had  ""technical"" issues throughout the day and were unavailable to ride until rectified.

With long wait times it is tempting to buy express passes which basically allow you to line up in a shorter line with priority access- (note-there is still a wait!). There are 2 types of passes both priced on top of your entry ticket...one is about S$50 and only allows you to express one time on each of the rides. The other is S$80  and you can go express more than one time. PLEASE NOTE the express passes seem to only permitted on SELECTED rides not ALL.

Cutting to the chase, the factors that ruined our experience

 - the cost of tickets and additional express passes is incredibly high! And I say this having visited Disneyland in HK.

 - the timings are ridiculous - 11 am - 6 pm! Are you kidding! With such less time, getting the expensive express pass is almost a mandate. And the express pass does not cover 3 specific rides including The Canopy which has the longest line!

- 3 of the rides that we either sat in (mid-way) or were eating to sit in had technical glitches and were delayed by 15-30 mins (when you already have limited time at the park, this doesn't help) . We were in the jurassic park water ride (The Rapids Adventure) when the ride was stopped for about 15-20 mins. We were stuck in the tube in a closed environment - stuffy, hot and claustrophobic.

- At least a couple of rides (including the famous puss-in-boots ride) were shutdown for maintenance.

TIPS:
1. Get the USS app in which you can see the waiting time for each attraction. The longest wait we had was 20 minutes. We just walked in for Transformers, the Mummy, Shrek 4D, and Jurassic Rapids.

Initially Transformers was closed for our visit but upon opening a bubble popped up on its location in the app, hence we were able to get on the ride before the majority of people found out that the rode was open.

2. Get your tickets bundled with the Singapore tourist pass (via Klook). By doing this we were able to get our tickets at about 65 SGD versus 83 SGD if you're planning to get just the USS tickets from their website.

1. Technical problems in some rides. For the Transformer ride we chose to wait for them to sort out the problem and we were able to go on the ride after less than 15 minutes. We were also not able to get on the Canopy flyer for our entire visit due to technical issues. 

2. Not much change and less attractions ( Waterworld was closed) as compared to our last visit.

3. The hotdog stand near Lights, Camera, Action does not sell hotdogs at the time of our visit. We were then told to buy our snacks near Battle Star Galactica.","Use the app to maximize your time, buy tickets bundled with the Singapore tourist pass.",2023-03-01,FAMILY,Tabby,,,,1

The Universal Studio is segmented into 6 zones which are The Lost World, including Jurassic Park; Ancient Egypt, including the Mummy; Sci-Fi City, including  Transformer; New York, including Sesame Street, Hollywood, including meeting with the Minion and lastly, Far Far Away, including Shrek and King Julien from Madagascar.

The park is relatively small, and compared to Overseas, you can explore all zones when you arrive. Suggested duration - You will be in the USS for over 3 hours.

Suggested duration - More than 3 hours.

First issue: Waiting time -  expect to wait more than 30 minutes or longer for popular rides.  

Second issue: Quality of the rides - if you have seen the latest Universal studio movies, the rides are during the first -release. Such as Shriek in the movie, Transformers. The mummy - when it was the first release. It is not the latest.

Straight up, we paid for Universal Express Unlimited (UXU) passes, and we believe that they were worth every cent. The park was quiet (we went on a Thursday outside of SG school holiday) but there were still queues. The UXU passes got us to the front of the line without any wait almost every time. The kids got to enjoy front row seats on all the main rides multiple times throughout the day. And by multiple times I literally mean dozens... something that was only possible thanks to the UXU passes. I know that the cost of the UXU passes makes many question their value, but in hindsight we all agree that having them made the day truly spectacular. And to top it off, the passes also get you through the priority entrance at the front gates too, another bonus! 

The USS App was very useful for navigating. Strongly recommend that you download. 

The park is relatively small, and Waterworld remains closed at time of writing, which was sad. But that said, we spend the entire day there and only stopped for lunch! 

Understanding the locker system and using them efficiently is key to enjoying the day too.  Can get a bit painful. But once you know the rules and get to know where the various banks of lockers are, then it all gets a bit easier. 

Drink outlets all sell the same, basically coke, lemonade, water and coconut water. Few other options but not much. Don't expect gourmet food, but it was fine, and the kids just wanted to get back to the rides anyway, so that was fine!

We didn't end up doing many of the rides we wanted to do, as the wait times were 1h for each ride, with only express riders getting on turn after turn. I guess if you are ok forking out the extra 60 SGD per ticket for the express passes, then it could be a great day out, but for 5 people we just couldn't stomach spending another 300 SGD.

Second issue: understaffing. Each ride was operated by a single person, which meant that that person would escort everyone out, then let all the riders on, then go around checking that each person is buckled. This process was often longer than the ride itself. 

Third issue: quality of rides. Some of the attractions were just bad. The Donkey standup comedy was absolutely terrible. The Shrek 4D show had a long prelude to it to summarize the movie. On the Madagascar carousel the attendant just yelled over the mic the entire time about someone not having buckled their seatbelt. Some of the rides were just really short.

When the queue was over 20 minutes we went for another ride and came back when the line was shorter. Of course we went on Monday so there wasn't a big growd anyway (but for example the transformers ride that had at some point 90 minute wait, we only had to wait for 5 when we went).

Of course the park is relatively small so don't expect something like Paris Disneyland. But we went to every ride once (except the rides for children) had a lovely lunch and it took 6-7 hours, so the park isn't small either. 

One negative aspect to note: You can't take your bag to the ride (as always) but most of the rides don't have a place to put them when you go on, you have to put it in a small locker before you even go to the line.

The queues for many of the rides were quite long, although one could get lucky and find shorter lines if a large group had already entered.

Firstly, do not go here without an express pass. Three times we abandoned queues for rides because they were not moving thanks to all of the spaces being filled up with express pass holders. This really isn't a fair way to operate and there should be a minimum amount of people from the 'normal' line let through for each run. Such an approach is more aligned with fast passes at Disneyland

At least half of the shops & food outlets were closed and the ones that were open had queues snaking out the doors.  I get that there is a labor shortage in Singapore but as a global conglomerate, they need to work out a solution to attract more staff. 

There is not nearly enough shade here. At one point, one of the cleaners could see that my 5 year old was struggling in the heat and went and got her an ice pack.

The park is very well themed, and we loved walking through all the different areas (especially Far Far Away Shrek theme). 

There aren’t a huge number of big ‘thrill rides’ but really recommend Cylon, Revenge of the Mummy, and Transformers 3D. The Jurassic Park Rapids was brilliantly themed and our favourite. As the weather deteriorated a lot (torrential rain) throughout the day it was great to have some indoor options for rides and attractions. The Shrek 3D film and Lights Camera Action were great (beware you’ll get soaked if you’re at the front)!

Given the heat having most of the queues and walking areas under cover was nice. The park was immaculately clean.

Waits for rides varied from 5 minutes (mainly for young children's riders) to 80 minutes in the second week of January. Overall, the park did not feel particularly crowded - well, until it poured with rain for about an hour and then it was difficut to find shelter!  Every available space was crammed with people.

In a full day we didn't get through all the rides or zones in the park. One large zone was closed off for the construction of new rides (probably Madagascar themed judging from the man-made trees and ships hull looming over you).  Our teenage children loved the high speed rollercoasters, which keep running even when it is pouring with rain. They only stop for lightening apparently. That can mean that you  queue for an hour for a ride, entering the queue in the sunshine and board a rollercoaster in a tropical downpour.

It was all still ok until until we visited Shrek 4D show. We enter the theater later and didn't manage to hear the instruction for no lap sitting. When the show started, one of the crew members came with a light baton and told me that my son couldn't on my lap. I completely understand why he shouldn't sit on my lap because the chair moves. I get it.

But he wasn't very friendly, to an adult, I can understand, especially after a long day of work and it was very crowded. To someone with a 2.5 yo toddler, I think the attitude was uncalled for. He basically shouted in front of my son. My son was shocked. 

There wasn't a choice gave to me. He didn't tell me we can move to stationery seats. He insisted for my son to be seated alone when the seats were tilted upward . In the middle of the show, I didn't want to affect the other visitors, I complied with the instruction, tried to put my son on the seat next to me, in a very dark room. Then, the seats dropped and reverted to original position. My son was shocked x2. That's where the nightmare started. My son started to cried non stop.

I had no choice but to leave the theater with him. I spoke to the crew outside the theater, then we realized that there were stationary seats. We re-entered but damaged is done. My son cried the moment we step into the theater. I can only hope that he has no phobia of cinema or theater. You can imagine what happened to the rest our day, a much anticipated outing--my son's first and maybe the worst theme park visit. 

My suggestion to the management. If USS is not meant for small kids, let's inform the visitor upfront. If USS does welcome smaller kids, please train your staff to be patient especially to those with smaller kids.

When we started to queue the attraction “Battlestar Galatica: Human” and the waiting time shown both at the entrance and on the official apps at that time were both 30 minutes.  Before that the USS staff forced us to put all the belongings in the assigned lockers, claiming that the free rental was up to 45 minutes.

However at the end we have waited for more than 150 minutes for the game.

When we get back to the lockers we were forced to pay S$ 12 to get back the belongings, as the free rental time had passes. Even we feedback to the USS staff on site saying that we had waited for the game far longer than expected which was out of our control but the staff insisted us to pay the lockers fees no matter the reason was.

We queued for another attraction “The revenge of Mummy” the waiting time shown at the entrance and the official apps were again as 30 minutes but eventually we have waited for over 80 minutes for the game.

Obviously there are a few issues to aware:

1.  The waiting time shown at the entrance and official apps is totally inaccurate and misleading:  shown as 30 minutes but eventually waited for 150 minutes and 80 minutes respectively.  I believe they have to let the guests know more accurately the waiting time therefore we have the right to choose wait or not.  To me 30 minutes is reasonable waiting time but if you inform me beforehand the waiting time is more than two hours I will definitely drop it.

Therefore don’t trust their waiting time as shown as they are dishonest and be prepared to wait for double time or more.

2.  The free rental time of the lockers is definitely not matching with the waiting time of the corresponding attraction, meaning that the guests are forced to pay for the almost “mandatory rental” lockers (considering even the cell phone have to be placed in the locker, it means the rental is almost mandatory for every guest) which is totally unfair to the guests.  Therefore please prepare to pay extra for the “mandatory” lockers.

3.  Some attractions are opening late i.e. 13:00 p.m. while the average waiting time when opened is very long.  During this peak time in Christmas holiday the late opening of some attractions is definitely a trick of the management to force the guests to pay extra money for the express pass.

We have been to various theme parks worldwide but our experience in Universal Studio Singapore was definitely the worst in my life, not one of, but the worst.  From the comments of other guests in tripadvisor I learnt that this is not a single incident but it seems that the management did not care about it and just giving a standard “copy and paste” reply here.

However, network was so bad that I couldnt access the USS app and map. Network was equally bad at the Malaysian foodcourt. I understand USS wanting to go online, but with such bad reception almost everywhere in USS, it becomes a nightmare for the guests.

Service staff was the other problem. They all seemed to have left their smiles at home especially the lady (or girl?) manning the customer service where I went to ask if they had a physical map. Totally unhelpful- just kept on saying quite rudely ""we dont have physical maps"" and when I told her I couldnt access the online map as the network was bad, she didnt offer any help but just looked angry and impatient.  Could see  that her face behind the mask was an unhappy one. Best part,  I was the only customer at the counter and this was before 11 am!! 

The other staff manning the rides also lacked smiles, and made me feel like I was bothering them to go on rides. Noticed they were all quite young.

The exception was this elderly staff at the entrance to USS. Friendly and offered help.

1. Buy Express pass as it saves a lot of time.DO NOT BUY EXPRESS UNLIMITED.  Express pass will give you express access to all the rides + 4 more rides of your choice. I don't think anybody can do more rides than this in a day so no point buying Express unlimited.
2. Avoid treasure Hunter ride (Opposite mummy ride). I am not a thrill seeker but this ride is slower than walking. It's out- dated and boring. There was no express line here so we stood there for an hour and it was not at all worth it. I wouldn't go in this even it's free.
3. Dont miss- transformers ride. It's not very high thrill but we, as a family found it the best. Though I am not transformers fan.
4.You can rent strollers, prams, small electric scooty once inside. I had rented a stroller for my son. Though someone stole it while we were doing one of the rides.

Wait times are unacceptably long and could be improved by simple fixes. (Buy the $50 Fast Pass if you don't want to wait 1.5 to 2h per ride)

(1) not enough staff- ex: merrygoround & magic potion spin has 1 staff to help disembark people, seat people & check if seatbelts are fastened (10min wasted!)

(2) They don't fill seats- i counted 8+ empty seats on the merrygoround, 3 consecutive empty carrigaes for spaghetti monster, etc

Heat / comfort
 
(1) Lack of misting / cooling fans in the park and around lines

Safety/ Clinics / Rest areas

(1) Our helper vomited after a rollercoaster, and there was no staff / clinic / air condition rest area nearby (within 10min walk)

Closed attractions

(1) Waterworld still closed (we visited on June & October 2022)

The 4 main attractions are high speed roller coasters (Cyclone / Human / Revenge of the Mummy / Transformers in decreasing order of scariness). Many rides do not allow kids below 5yrs so plan accordingly, but even with the kids this place is a must watch.
On weekend, most of the rides have approx 1 hour long queues so either plan this on weekdays or (my suggestion is) overspend a little here and buy express pass which will allow you to skip the queues. The reason behind my suggestion is weekends are crowded everywhere and and no where else you can prevent crowd from from spoiling them your experience.

I will review the rest of it as a Q&A.

Q - Is this a must-watch in Singapore?
A - Definitely Yes,

Q - What to expect here?
A - Rides for both adults and kids. 4-D effect movies. Lots of places to click photographs. Super expensive food.

Q - What are the Vegetarian Food options ?
A - Do not buy food from inside. They allow outside food so pack some burgers / snadwiches / anything you like from outside.

Q - Do I need to cover all of it?
A - Yes, but only possible on weekdays or weekend with express pass.

Q - What are its main attractions? 
1) 4 roller costers mentioned earlier
2) Kids rides (dont remember names, just walk past by the 4 rides mention in #1 then they will appear)
3) Movie Show
4) Boat Ride (it was closed when I visited, but looked good)
5) There is a theatre sort of thing on left hand side right through the first passage after entrace.

Q - Suggested Route to cover attractions mentioned above.
A - Just keep walking and watching there is just 1 route one can follow.

For 2 adults, a teenager that somehow counts as an adult and 2 children we paid the better part of S$800 for tickets and Express passes. 

Once we were in the park we had to queue for over 30 minutes just to get the Express pass wristband. When you finally get your wristband you’re told that there are 4-5 rides that don’t even accept the pass and then there were 2 rides that were totally offline. 

To top things off about 20% of the park is shut for renovation. Obviously the ticket cost doesn’t reflect this. 

While the fast passes give you a shorter line, expect to queue for 45-60 minutes for the Battlestar Galactica rides otherwise it shows as 2 hours. 

Character meet and greets are advertised and timings are kept to relatively well but they’re all so devoid of any life. Everything feels so sterile. 

Food options are atrocious and RWS & Universal Studios should be ashamed of themselves. Half the restaurants are shut, those that are open are so full of people that you should expect to queue for 90 minutes just for fried chicken that you wouldn’t even touch after a night drinking in London because it is that inedible. 

We spent 40 minutes queueing for the cotton candy machine until the machine scammed the poor man in front of me and gave him a stick with nothing on it. There were no staff around to rectify the issue.

ABER:
* Die Fahrtzeit der Fahrgeschäfte ist äußerst kurz (teilweise gefühlt nicht einmal eine Minute), vor allem in Relation zur Wartezeit

* Aufgrund der (optionalen) Express Tickets wird einem der Parkbesuch einfach nur vermiest und man ist hart an der Grenze, den Park erbost vorzeitig zu verlassen:
a) Der Park öffnet erst um 12 Uhr Mittags und schließt bereits um 7 Uhr Abends, man hat also bestenfalls 7 Stunden zur Verfügung, um sich alles anzuschauen und die Fahrgeschäfte zu nützen. Für $ 81 für Nichteinheimische ist das mMn sehr mager.

b) Die Warteschlangen sind enorm (man steht teilweise mehr als 90 Minuten in der Warteschlange, und das an einem Mittwoch!) und das Erlebnis im Park wird durch die Vielzahl an verkauften Express Tickets noch zusätzlich arg getrübt: Während man ohne Express Ticket ewig in der Warteschlange steht, ziehen die mit einem Express Ticket Priviligierten ($ 91 Aufpreis für die Unlimited-Version und damit teurer als der eigentliche Eintritt, insgesamt dann $ 172 pro Erwachsenem!) an der Warteschlange in einer eigenen Spur an einem vorbei, während man selbst beim Warten versauert. Und als ob das nicht schon reichen würde, wird man ohne Express Ticket gleich doppelt benachteiligt, weil beim Einsteigen (wo sich beide Spuren wieder treffen) die Express Ticket-Inhaber nochmals bevorzugt behandelt werden und verhältnismäßig öfter einsteigen dürfen als ""Normalsterbliche"".
Leider werden anscheinend auch so dermaßen viele Express Tickets verkauft, dass man ohne ein Express Ticket einen Großteil des Tages in den diversen Warteschlangen verbringt, anstatt Spaß zu haben. Hier müsste dringend am Geschäftsmodell etwas geändert werden, so macht das Ganze definitiv keinen Spaß.

This would be our third time going to universal studios in Singapore in 5 years and we had read some pretty poor reviews. Currently operating with reduced days, so we did have to plan which day we went and we chose a Thursday. Gates were open at 11:45, with some rides commencing their runs at 11:55.
We did not notice any difference in waiting times from when we visited pre-pandemic. Wait times for the Battlestar Galactica ride has always been around the 50 minute mark so don’t be discouraged when this has been  written in other reviews. It has also been at 90 minutes (this was a New Year’s Eve night), but on this visit there was only 50 minutes max. I was waiting with the youngest child while my eldest son went on the ride.

The food court by the lost word / Jurassic park section is not open but there are plenty of food options - there is a pizza bar in the Sesame Street section, American Diner (Mel’s) off the Main Street, and in far far away some nachos, hot dogs and things.

I’m not sure about the comments regarding no meet and greets, as we saw a number of these occurring. There were minions, Elmo and Oscar, Shrek and the Transformer character. These occurred throughout the day. Minions were every 2 hours.

Additionally, this place isn't great for younger children (I had a 6 yr old with me), but rather for older kids and adults who like thrill rides. This, combined with all of the closures, there was barely anything age-appropriate for us to do. 

Treasure Hunter? CLOSED. Rock climbing wall? CLOSED. All those shows you read about online like Waterworld, Sesame Street, and Donkey LIVE? CLOSED. Magic Potion Ferris Wheel? CLOSED. Snack stands and key restaurants (Frairs, Lost World Food Court)? CLOSED. And that's just the stuff we targeted.  

The Express Pass was useless and a waste --$100 down the drain. We used it on 2 rides! And for those 2 rides, it made no difference. In fact, the Sesame Street Spaghetti Chaser Express entrance put us in the same spot as everyone else, but made us walk even further to the queue (and due to some misrouting, actually led us out an exit). There was barely a line at the carousel. 

Effectively, the Universal Studios Singapore experience is about taking photos with characters (“meet and greets""), selling you retail stuff (plenty of shops open!), and keeping a few rollercoasters open to justify the admission price. Of course, they kept the rides open that sell you extra stuff --like the water ride where they can hard sell you a one-off locker rental ($10), a poncho ($5), and using a drying booth ($5).

I was also pretty furious when after waiting for over 30 mins in a covid swamp of an underground queue (on a ride wait time of apparently 15 mins...), they then say over the loudspeaker that if you have any unsecured items (bags, hats, sunglasses) that you won't be permitted to ride! I had a hat on and was on my own so couldn't give it to anyone so had to leave the ride! Why didn't the guy at the entrance say something?

Before you decide to visit, you might want to know that:
- almost half the rides were closed (under maintenance).
- almost half of all food stores were closed. The main dinosaur food court and restaurants were closed. Gotta queue for at least 20 minutes just for kiosk food.
- open just half a day 12-6pm.
- there were minimal, probably overstretched staff for each station.
- all shows were still closed, which they said it was due to social distancing but... it was more likely that they didn't have anymore entertainers.
- not necessary to get express passes, as there ain't many rides to use them on.
- pretty sad for the wheelchair-users, because 2 out of 4 wheelchair-friendly rides were closed. The promised-to-be-wheelchair-friendly Madagascar carousel ride turned out to be a false promise because the platform was too high for wheelchairs to get on... So only the 10-minute Shrek video was available, that's all.

If you do plan to visit, just be prepared mentally that:
- you will pay the same pre-pandemic prices, for half the rides, time, maybe service.
- you may be surrounded by many hangry people. You might become one, too.
- if you are bringing someone on wheelchair, he/she will be paying the same price to play nothing, watch (almost) nothing, and have no respite from the torturous heat since there was almost ZERO air-conditioned places they could enter, except the crowded souvenir shops and the futuristic car museum at the far end of the park.

6,842438229,2022-06-11,OTHER,1,"Visited Universal Studios Singapore (USS) in June 2022. I used to own an annual pass to USS before covid. Comparisons:

1. Tickets are now a swindle. Overpriced. Although they are opened at 12pm to 6pm, you barely get 30 mins to 1hr of fun (eliminating all the walking and LONG WAITING TIME you need to do inside). Psst: The waiting time on the average for EACH RIDE (1 RIDE ONLY PER PERSON) is about 45 mins to 240mins). For 30mins to 1hr, you need to pay almost a hundred bucks per ticket and usually you won't be going here if you are alone. So imagine you have to pay almost a hundred bucks x the number of people going... with the same duration of 30mins to 1hr... would you still go? Well, I had to cut down from a family trip to half a family going for the trip, mainly just me and the kids... From their ticket prices, you can already see that their business model now is mainly about money inflow.

2. Although their memberships in the past were ridiculously expensive, I could still bring the family to USS during the holidays whenever I wish to. Now, they refused to renew any memberships and they stopped issuing memberships for obvious reasons. They can sell Day tickets at a swindle price and you won't get a second chance to visit this place without paying for another ridiculously overpriced ticket. Again, showing that their business model is leaning towards cash inflow into their cooperation.

3. The rides were NOT MAINTAINED and there were parts of the rides that weren't working. I know where the errors are because I went there frequently before COVID and I went there again in June 2022. For example, the Madagascar Boat Ride, the beginning 3 stacked up crates were supposed to move slanted towards the visitors' boat, but instead, they stayed very still. Many of the lights were no longer functioning. The worst ride with most error was the Sesame Streets Space Ride where you sit in a ""spaceship"" and you enter ""space"". Not only were many lightings not lighted up, some of the animated characters did not even move. For example, the part where the Dustbin monster was supposed to pop out and back into the dustbin did not even pop out. The character that was stretched with hands and legs did not even move, etc.

Again, unmaintained rides because the management decided to claw back as much cash inflow as possible to ""compensate"" their ""imaginary losses during the COVID"".

Would you want to bring your beloved ones and family to a theme park with zero maintenance and charges you close to a hundred dollars for less than an hour's dangerous rides? You won't be able to predict when the malfunctions will get worse but you can almost be certain that a malfunction will surely occur soon. Because there is no maintenance.

I don't understand why Tripadvisor is rating them as #1? Don't they know this is probably the last thing visitors will ever want to return to visit? What kind of theme park DOES NOT have an annual or seasonal pass and can still be rated as Rank #1 on Tripadvisor?

Tripadvisor, you are discrediting yourself if USS continues to hold Rank #1.

Read on to know this place better! 

However, it can get VERY crowded, so I recommend you to go on weekdays, if possible. When there, (if you are there on weekend) remember to go to the right hand corner to buy express tickets, or else you will need to wait for a very long time. We tried waiting for the  Transformers ride last time without express, and we waited for almost an hour! It will cost money, but I think it is worth it :)

If you are bringing kids, I recommend you to make a stop at the first ride, and then move on to transformers. There is also a lot of thrilling and fun roller coasters. A memorable ride was the mummies, but there IS a height restriction. Many people will complain about the price of the food, but there is a pizza restaurant in Universal Studios which is absolutely delicious. However, if you don't want to pay the price, I suggest you buy the food from OUTSIDE the place as there are many appetising meals offered in the food court as well.

The preferred time to play there is more than 3 hours, and it's best to play there for a whole day, or else you cannot really experience all the fun with the waiting.

Some downsides, though. The castle, which I was looking forward too, is closed. I remember going to it last time, probably in 2019, and there was a movie inside, which was thrilling as well. The Water World is also closed, due to COVID-19, but if it does open again, the show is absolutely fantastic, and it was surreal.

For a family of 3, we paid SG$220 and it was not worth the price of admissions.  The first is, many of the shows were not available, like waterworld, the steven spielberg experience and others.  Secondly, there were many rides, especially for kids were not closed, and literally one fifth of the park, comprising the whole Madagascar area were closed off. But the worst part is that, the food and beverage services were incredibly AWFUL!!. Most of the restaurants and the beverage stalls are closed.  And when the stalls that are open are understaffed.  Just to get a bottle of water, people literally had to stand in a long queue, maybe as long as the ride itself.

Lastly the people who work there are so rude.  The way they respond towards my complaint or my inquiries was not within the standards of what a service oriented industry should be.

COVID-19 has been around for two years; it is not an acceptable excuse to shut down so much of the park and still charge the same amount. There is a lack of disclosure and accountability to visitors of the park and we would surely not be visiting anytime soon.

Arrived on our scheduled day early and the line to enter universal was over 90 minutes. It seemed all of Singapore was lined up and with absolutely no 1.5 meter gaps. Once we were in the rides were over 100 minutes wait with people up each others back sides lining up. Absolutely no social distancing being practiced. To avoid the queues, I went back to the store and purchased the express path which was another $300. When joining the Xpress lines people were right up each others back sides, again no social distancing and staff and park management couldn’t care less. When we got to the ride entrance it was clear the advertised “50% capacity” meant letting full capacity into the park, but closing every second seat or every second row depending on the ride therefore ‘limiting the rides’ to 50% capacity. Queues were upwards of 160 minutes on some rides because of “COVID POLICY”.  Yet, the “Carnies” operating the rides didn’t care that everyone in the line was up each others backside , but when it came to climbing in a ride, they made sure that each ride only had half the capacity of riders. Just dumb !! To top it off whilst in line for the first ride the heavens opened and the park closed all the rides for nearly 3 hours. No refunds, no save your ticket for another day, just  $680 down the drain. When several staff were approached as to when rides would reopen they just put their arms up in the air and pretended they didn’t understand English. It rained so much and for so long that there was no escaping it. All indoor areas were closed again because of this stupid Covid policy. Any chance of getting a meal meant you had to line up for over 150 m and it took me over 50 minutes lining up in the rain to get a hotdog for my kids whilst they were  standing under a tree getting drenched. The indoor food court undercover seating area in the Jurassic World section was closed  -  all they had to do was use their brains and apply some common sense as well as some respect for their patrons and open the doors. All the while I lined up for 50 minutes to order a couple of hotdogs only for it to take another 35 minutes for my number to be called. So after nearly 5 hours, we left and all we had to show for it was a saggy soggy cold meal, 3 kids soaked through in wet clothes, 2 rides, no entertainment and the privilege of paying $680 Singapore dollars for it.

1. so many attractions/rides have been closed

3. Queue restrictions and rides/attractions restricts number of visitors that can enjoy the ride at one time

In view of points 2&3 above there would be a limit on  the number of visitors who can enjoy the rides at any point in time and so a logical limit on the number  of visitors that can be accommodated for the rides for a day

Despite of the above restrictions and resulting capacity limitations, the greedy Universal studios sells many more tickets compared to the capability they can honour/service during the day. This results in visitors having to queue long long for the rides. E.g. we queued for more than 5 hours and managed to get in to 3 rides only and didn't get any time to enjoy the environment

Due to school holiday the whole USS is on full capacity today, is even crowded than before COVID. The queue to go in snake all the way one round to the other end. However it was quite smooth and fast to enter. 

Every station we are are very long queue and hot. All restaurants are long queue to go in and even buy a drink have to queue for 15 min minimum. Suggest they could put a few drink / snack machine station. They could still sell their sky rocket price but at least save our queue time. 

Even when we reach the drink booth many option of the drinks are not available. Nothing really suitable for young children and the weather was so hot. 

We spend 90% of the timing just queueing literally by 3plus we already don’t feel like staying there. 

The plus point to share is they started to change plastic mineral water to paper container type of mineral water, but there were no sign of recycle bin available around for us to throw. So what’s the point of changing to sustainable material but no option for people to recycle it ? 

Now they also reduce paper print and don’t give map anymore. Is a good move but when we try to download the USS app to check showtime / greet and meet. There were no reception at USS for long time. By the time I manage to download the app we already half way exhausted from queueing. There is definitely something wrong with the reception or network there. 

No sign of sanitization at any play area I guess they have no time no man power. Only one cleaner sanitize our dining table before we sit. 

Wish they could install more cooler fan around the area and provide more free sitting place. Even we buy drink or snack at the booth there are not many sitting places around we end up have to sit around the floor or staircase area to rest our tiring feet. Those outdoor area for restaurant are all left empty as the restaurant unable to cater more capacity but yet it remain cordoned up and public cannot use it like the past. Then they should rather don’t Corden the outdoor let it Be use by other public like the past or cordon half area for restaurant diner.

Top tip: Reach early and head straight for the rides once they open, most people will be taking pictures at the entrance and hence, shorter queues.

Food: 
Pricey but tasty, even those sold at food carts. 
I would recommend pizzas at Louis NY Pizza Parlour and Shrek waffles at Goldilocks.

Rides:
A good variety from extreme (dueling rollercoasters) to kiddie friendly (Treasure Hunters). Wait times can be long, so I would recommend an express pass, especially if visiting during a peak period.

The average waiting time for a ride is about 80 mins. My niece wanted to go on the mummy ride and despite the sign saying it was an 80 min wait, we ended up waiting for 2.5-3hours. Turns out, the mummy ride only allowed 2 groups per ride = 4 people. So you imagine the wait. And because it took us so long to take the mummy ride, the lockers ended up charging us $4 because we exceeded the free 130 time limit. All the other rides were also packed or they stopped accepting people. I'd imagine that the rides were long wait due to safe distancing however some rides did not do such extreme safe distancing as per the mummy (4 people per ride).
The restaurants/food carts where we had food vouchers to spend were also packed as everyone was queueing at one or the other to use their vouchers. Not all restaurants and/or food carts were operating.
In the end, we only managed to ride about 3 rides after all the queueing and spent our vouchers in the late afternoon when everyone was queueing for rides.
I thought there was a capacity limit to entering USS however when we were scanning to enter, they didn't check against our date booking if we booked a slot. So am not sure if the limit was implemented.

1)  Множество разных развлечений, например,  аттракционов по мотивам Трансформеров. Вы садитесь в кресло, которые вращается во все стороны, и едете по рельсам. После этого вы начинаете вращаться во все стороны и погружаетесь в 5D атмосферу. Вокруг вас на экранах показывают действия из фильмов и вы как-будто являетесь соучастником событий.
2) Очень большое количество кафе на острове  на разный вкус и кошелёк: китайская кухня, тайская кухня, малайзийская кухня, европейская кухня. Всем советую посетить известную сеть почечных Dunkin donuts, где готовят очень вкусные пончики. 
3) Отели. На острове есть несколько отелей, которые славятся своей концепцией, а в некоторых есть сногшибательный вид на океан. Да, отели довольно дорогие, но несколько вариантов того стоят. Также, если вы поселитесь а одном из них, то у вас будет специальный абонемент, по которому вы сможете получить скидку на некоторые услуги.

The food was great,atmosphere was good and all the rides had reasonable queue times.
I just have one bad experience,mainly at the Far far away.Just as i alighted the Puss-in-Boots ride,and was heading out,i was walking out and a lot of people were walking out too.So I accidentally walked a bit out of line and wanted to walk out.Yes it’s my fault for that,however,one of the worker procceeded to stretch his arm out to my stomach and push me back to line.
A simple warning or just telling me to get back would have been okay,but i feel like having contact like that,is not tolerable honestly.Luckily i kept my cool and just walked off,but i feel like the workers should be more patient and carry out their guest operations more calmly,not with physical contact.Yes,it was my fault rhat i walked out of line,but it was really minimal and didn’y deserve to get an arm to my stomach.I too noticed a worker at the Farfaraway dragon ride that shouted at another person because she was taking her time to walk up the stairs after the ride.
Guest management should be better at the Farfaraway,and i hope this would go a long way.

As a local, I've been to the park more than I can remember, including the 6 years of Horror Nights I have went, with season passes and frequent fear passes. It is safe to say I know the park at the back of my hands. 
I love this place, simply because it is the only theme park in Singapore. I've been to USS for the second time since the pandemic started, once was in November 2020. Yes, coming on a public holiday, I expected crowds and the weather to be bad, totally understandable. Average waiting time for each ride around 5pm was 1-2 hours, okay sure, I can handle that, I've been in line for 3 hours for a haunted house before. I came with a group of friends that were new to theme parks and rides in general, so I really wanted to complete most of the major attractions with them.  What bugged me was how slack the social distancing was in some attractions. The Transformers and the Rapids ride had staff telling guests to remain in the boxes while queuing. While I was in the Mummy ride queuing, there was no social distancing enforced and everyone was just cramped together in the tight space. Not to mention, it was around 2pm and they had a technical fault, so we ended up getting on the ride only around 3.30pm, when asked the staff roughly how long it would take, they responded with a simple ""i don't know."" Me and my group were trying to remain in the boxes and maintain that distance with everyone else cramped in the indoor setting, but it was just impossible. Not to mention, as there was no staff there, many had their face masks down, which really bugged my group as we felt really exposed. 
We were told the rides open at 2 and had early entry to the park. We went at around 12.30, searched for lunch and while eating, we saw that the rides have already operated at around 1.30pm, which caused abit of a rush and confusion for my group as we wanted to be first in line for BSG, but when we got there, it was already crowded. We went to Canopy flyer, which had a technical difficulty, we heard from some passing people that Transformers was down too, so if the rides had issues, shouldn't the park have made sure everything was good before opening the ride instead of rushing to open them? Just my 2 cents.The app for the wait times is a good idea but it doesn't update very frequently, so we have to run back and forth just to make sure that we have enough time to complete at least 3/4 of the rides. (Which we did, completed 10 thank goodness) But we did not stop to eat anything for the rest of the day till 9 pm to complete them. So for people coming on public holidays, please have a hearty meal before coming in as you might not have time to stop for food. We had corndog vouchers that came with the tickets, but the line for it was so long, probably about 50 over in the queue, so we gave it up. 
We do understand crowds are something that cannot be controlled, plus even with the regulations, the limit for the park is still quite a lot. We just hope that more safe distancing can be enforced on such days as these are the days where more people will be exposed to the virus and people. When I came in November, almost every ride queue had someone to enforce the distancing. 
I was quite disappointed yesterday, but I am still giving 5 stars because of my love for the park and the wonderful staff that still served with a smile on their face on a busy day. I will be back soon and hopefully, the social distancing system will be much more efficient and better.",A Very Different Experience,2021-02-01,NONE,Luna,,,,1

3,780237441,2020-12-30,OTHER,1,"My 2 daughters (7 and 4) and I visited on 28th Dec. We had a terrible experience on many levels. We are repeat annual pass holders. 

Let me start by saying we knew that there was a risk of crowds during the school holidays. Also, we know that we are in a unique situation with Covid and many businesses are struggling with the measures needed to keep safe. 

However, it seems USS are really putting guest experience low down on the list of priorities. Guest safety has to come of course but at what cost?

The trouble for us started even before we got to in to the park. We arrived at 2pm and the entry queue was all the way passed Candylicious i.e. at least 500m away. I approached a USS staff at the queue and asked if there was still a priority line for annual pass holders. She told me ""no, please join the line."" So I had to walk all the way to the back of the line. After 1 minute of queuing another staff noticed our lanyards and said if we're annual pass holders then go to the front and use the priority queue.  

Once in the park, the theme of queuing was everywhere. My 7 year old decided to queue for Enchanted Airways  so she went in alone and I was watching her from the front of the building. The queue moved and she went out of sight around the side of the building and I followed. I didn't notice at first but the queue went around the side of the building, down the back, and returned to the main entrance. What was appalling was that most of the queue was left exposed to the sun.

This is unforgiveable. It showed me right there that USS are more concerned about $$$ than people. 

I pulled my daughter out of the queue as she said ""Daddy, this is too much"". 

Every single other ride we stopped at (including the Madagascar merry go round) looked like the wait was at least 45 - 60 mins. The more popular rides I would say you'd need to queue for at least 90 mins - 2 hours. This is just nuts. 

We spent the rest of the afternoon just going around the shops and people watching. One thing that USS did do well was putting on more frequent character shows which was enjoyable. 

Then we tried to get into Mel's Drive In for dinner. Guess what, we had to queue to get in, had to queue to order and then wait for the food prep. 

All in all this was a terrible experience for us. Again I want to say that this is no fault of the staff in the park. This issue is firmly with senior management and their interpretation of what is acceptable sacrifice under the current management measures. It looks like they've decided that guest experience is the first to go. 

I am a senior operations leader in the real estate industry so I know full well how hard it is to get a balance at the moment. But for USS, the numbers in the park simply need to be controlled better. They've got the balance wrong right now and guests are suffering.

For my experience when I was queuing for the battlestar galactica it started to rain and they didn't close at all. They will only close when there thunderstorms/lightning or very bad heavy rain. But yea they still open it when it's drizzling and raining:) When at night around 7-8 most rides queue are rlly short. For my experience I rided the human and cylon at around 8-9 and there was honestly no queue only for the cylon only a few people in front but at night the view are spectacular! I recommend booking first before coming. Cause going inside without booking queue could be quite LONG. And I mean it. Most food restaurants are close but the ones open queue are long aswell and expensive but the food is very delicious! Don't bring too much stuff or big bags into uss as when yr riding the attractions u HAVE to put yr belongings in the locker and the lockers are quite tiny. The lockers is free for the first 45 mins so when yr going to change your attractions rides u should change to another locker that is close to the ride if you want free lockers. 
Rides I recommend for teens or adults that's above 125 in height: revenge of the mummy,cylon,human
For kids:Puss in boots and other kiddi rides:)

On 10 December 2020 ,Thursday, we went on a family outing to Universal Studios Theme Park together with our children.

We entered the park at 1 pm and proceeded to have our lunch. After lunch , we decided to visit the ride called “Puss in Boots Adventure”

Our daughter checked the description from the YouTube video and it stated that it is a gentle ride. We queued up and was informed by the duty personnel that there was a slight delay in starting the ride as they needed to “TEST” the ride.

After a half hour wait , about 2 pm we boarded the capsule ( four of us in one capsule ) ‘

The capsule glided upwards slowly. Then the ride downwards began to gain speed  after we reached the Higher levels and  very soon it suddenly jammed to a stop  abruptly ( similar to someone braking very hard as the car was travelling at speed 40 KM/hr.)

The abrupt and sudden stop caused our body to hit very hard against the safety bar in front of us. (Forward momentum and sudden stop )

Before we could recover , the capsule moved forward again at fast speed for 30 seconds before coming to another abrupt and sudden stop . This again caused our body to lunge forward and hit against the safety bar / restraint. Then it moved forward at a fast speed again

After a couple more of such unpleasant and abrupt stops , we reached the end of the ride.

Our complaint is that

1.Such abrupt “stop and start” are intentional and caused by the technician's programme.
2.it was unexpected that this ride would be so violent , jerky and unsafe. We spoke with the staff at the gate when we queued up and she said it is  a slow gentle ride downwards.
3.It caused great discomfort to us and others during and after the ride.

Given the fact that the park now operates within limited hours - 2 pm to 9 pm only, effort should have been made to control the number of people who are able to book and enter the park on any given day, to provide a conducive environment for all. However, this was not the case and for some rides, the waiting time was 2 hours, after which all other visitors were turned away as the queue was temporarily closed. Most other rides had a waiting time of between 1 hour and 1.5 hours.

4,779039988,2020-12-11,OTHER,2,"Really disappointing experience.  I have visit USS many times and this is the only one time that we couldn't wait to leave the place.  Firstly, although early entry is at 12 noon, rides only start at 2 p.m. Some were opened a bit earlier.  During normal time, the 2 hours could be just nice for us to grab a bite, do some shopping or walk around to catch some meet and greet.  But unfortunately, there was very limited food outlets opened, so each food outlet has long queues.  And the meet and greet sessions were few and far in between.  So it was a really boring 2 hours.  

Once the rides started at 2p.m., the queues are super long.  This is due to some shows and rides are not opened plus the fact that most restaurants and food outlets were closed, yet there is a good crowd.  Hence the visitors would have nothing to do but to take the rides.  Each ride queue is really 1 hour or more.  So be prepared to maybe have maximum 5 rides during your visit.  Worst still is when it rains, as the restaurants were closed, there is little place for shelter. 

The place also looks very much in need of a good uplift, paint work is getting faded and dated and looks unattractive.  Also please do thorough checks for technical glitches before the rides open and not during ""showtime"".

After arriving at 1200pm (to enjoy early entry) I was surprised to learn that rides did not start operating until 130pm. Which was not advised in advance.

Entry to park was relatively easy, however, overall experience was very much reduced by the very RUDE, AGGRESSIVE, AND DISRESPECTFUL 'so called' SAFE DISTANCING AMBASSADORS deployed throughout the park, in numbers it seemed more than the park employers. These folks truly made the experience truly forgettable...
-yelling at families walking too closely together
-harassing families of 3 and 4 lining up for rides, informing them that even families of 3 and 4 cannot line up together for rides due to alledged government regulations (which is incorrect as the government rule is now groups of 5).
-just generally being RUDE and lacking any customer service training: for example ""Sir, please stand being the line... SIR, YOU ARE STANDING ON THE LINE""

Generally regular employees were pleasant, however, reduced capacity on rides made posted waiting times to be very inaccurate.

Rides were operating at slower than normal intervals, which, along with reduced capacity on each ride led to very long waiting times given park admission was supposed to be limited to 25%.

A number of attractions were closed.

Overall disappointing experience given there was no discount on ticketing.

Recommendation: AVOID UNTIL PARK HAS PROPERLY REOPENED and SOCIAL DISTANCING AMBASSADORS RECEIVE PROPER  CUSTOMER SERVICE TRAINING.",AVOID UNTIL PARK IS COVID 19 RESTRICTIONS HAVE BEEN  REMOVED AND SOCIAL DISTANCING STAFF HAVE PROPER TRAINING,2020-07-01,FAMILY,CJF,"Singapore, Singapore",Singapore,Singapore,-1

So yes of course, the park had to be very careful with safety and hygiene, but then don't open the park with so many people, and with unlimited fast pass... 

We paid 59 SGD, and got into 4 attractions in total in the 4 hours we spent there. And hold on, the attractions were:
- 2 times Transformers,
- 1 time one of the Galactica (for which we waited 1h30 in the queue)
- 1 time a very lame attraction next to the Galactica, because there was no-one queuing. 

At some point, we had some hope to go in the Mummy because we were given a pass for a later timing, but once there on the expected time, the announced queue was more than 1 hour. WTF!

Please review your number of admissions in the park, or try to be more efficient on the cleaning, and do not allow the unlimited fast pass. We saw so many guys doing 3 to 4 times the Galactica for instance while we were still in the queue.

Safe distancing ambassadors are around to enforce the rules. Machines are cleaned after every ride.  Had Vegetarian Noodles at Discovery food court and I loved it :) .

You're getting a park with a few great rides but it is only a small place so for any age group there's likely to be less than 5 attractions that really hit a sweet spot.  Its a theme park and it's in Singapore so of course it's not cheap and I'd say it's generally worth the express pass if you don't want to devote a full day and 40+ mins queueing per ride.  Human, Cylon, Mummy and Transformers are the proper thrill rides and all good fun.  
The F&B options are terrible and USS should be ashamed that they don't offer any healthier choices than highly processed food and drinks packed with additives, sugar and salt.   It's 2020 and I think they are misreading their customers... I think a lot of people now want healthier, lighter options.  Get a Salad Stop franchise in there, an Acai Affair and a Sushi Tei, to provide a bit more variety.

Although the park is small, it never feels crowded.  But at first we did find queue times excessive, worse than on previous visits to Singapore.
Rides are well maintained and compared to the UK breakdowns are infrequent.  There is a good choice of rides, from exciting roller coasters to gentle well themed rides.
In addition the park is well themed, so do spend some time just enjoying this; don’t miss the walkway around the lake, you get some great views from there.
Food in the park is good, but expensive.  However do think how much you’ve paid to be in the park, I feel it’s better to accept the higher prices and enjoy the experience in the well themed restaurants, rather than save money by leaving the park.
There’s an app which is a fairly easy way to get park opening hours but watch out, it doesn’t open to the day of your visit, it always opens to the first of the month, sometimes the previous month.  Queue times are erratic, and often incorrect, but it gives you some idea of how busy the park is.
Even when the park was busy, there was quite a gap between shows at Shrek and Lights Camera Action.  They won’t give a countdown timer for the next show, nor tell you when the show starts, so assume you’ll have to wait for the full waiting time displayed at the show entrance.  Only Waterworld has shows at set times which is clearly displayed.
There’s a fountain area near the food court in Jurassic Park, it’s been broken for over a year.
I’m disabled and I find the staff gave us an exceptional amount of help.  Because we spent quite a few days in the park we were recognised and warmly welcomed when we arrived, and staff made sure we had an easy entrance to the park.  They also ensured we had a really good time going on the rides.
By contrast, the design of the park is poor for the disabled.  Full marks to Enchanted Airways for providing a special staircase for the disable, nice wide gentle steps, and even a stairlift.  But why oh why didn’t they give the staircase a handrail?
The disabled could enjoy all the shows, but the design really spoils the shows for the disabled.
Shrek 4D, we had to enter the theatre early, and missed part of the pre-show.  That was our only complaint, although we always have to sit rather to one side.
Waterworld, the disabled sit at the very back.  In addition I couldn’t see the most spectacular stunt, because a block of speakers blocked my view.  I used to really enjoy the show when I could sit near the front, I won’t bother to watch it again, I was so far from the action.
Lights Camera Action, after baking in the queue area I was required to stay at the very end of the row, and couldn’t see most of the show.  Really disappointing, I won’t be going again.
If you live in Singapore, I’m sure you’ll have a great time there while visitor numbers are low.

Once again this is mohit , hope you all are under lockdown state , I travelled Singapore a month back from 5th March to 11th March 2020 . We were also very scared to go but atlast we made it . 
It was a very fruitful trip to Singapore for us as due to covid 19 many of the travellers cancelled their trips and due to that there was no crowd or ques anywhere in any of the tourist spot . 
We reached universal studio at 12 pm in afternoon and we finished well on time at 5 pm which is a closing time for the park . 
It’s full of fun for all age group from 2 years Kids till aged people . I was accompanied by my wife 2 years daughter and my senior citizens mother father .
The main attractions are both the roller coasters and the dark room roller coaster means 3 rides and the transformer ride , if you do these 4 rides your ticket value you have used it as these 4 rides are very new and uncommon in other parks anywhere else . 
For the food veg options are very less , you can take your own in bags , rest options are also very expensive . 
Some pics I have attached for the reference but if you have gone in a peak season the ques are huge so be at time at 9 am sharp When gates are open, as sharp 5 PM they close all rides and no entry is allowed .

Because of the corona virus scare the park was very empty with only about a five minute wait for any ride which was perfect as we had three young children with us!  Easily walkable for any age. My family had annual passes and it was $38 for my day pass. If you go with someone who has a pass you get a reduction from regular fare.  Prices for food and gifts in the various places were what you would expect in a theme park.  The Mummy ride had technical issues while we were on it meaning we had to get off it!  My seven year old granddaughter was being brave and trying it for the first time with her Mom and I and was freaking out a bit at the mummy room when it stopped!  Now her Mom and I were temporarily freaking out a bit lol.  Since they needed to turn on the lights to get us off the ride she saw the special effects which made it possible to get her back on it when it was fixed. She absolutely loved the ride and can’t wait to go back again!   It’s a great ride!  All the rides were fun and we had a great time there.

カウントダウン用のチケット(年によってあったりなかったりするみたい)が発売されているかを確認し、なかったのでその場でvoyaginで通常のチケットを購入しバウ��ャーを発券して入場しました。(バウチャはチケットへの交換が必要です)

人はそこそこ多かったのですが、どのアトラクションにもほとんど並んでいなくてトランスフォーマーやマミーなど気に入ったアトラクションに何度も乗りました。(マミーは待ち時間なしでした)
サイクロンは15分くらい待ちました。怖すぎて楽しくなかったので一度しか乗りませんでした。
長靴をはいた猫のコースターは子供向けかなと思ってたけど、結構高いところまで登るのでスリルもあって楽しかった！
夕方はミニオンたちに列が出来ていたので後回しにしたら、その後もう会うことはなかったです。子供は残念がっていました。
Lucyとグルーさんの登場するショウが23時くらいからやっていました。
事前に調べたところカウントダウンの日は閉園の1時までアトラクションに乗れるとのことでしたが、0時前にはほとんどのアトラクションがクローズしていました。なので、事前調べだけを当てにせず現地でちゃんと確認した方が良いですね！
パレードはなかったです。
濡れるアトラクションでは大阪だと皆さんレインコート購入してますが、こちらではわたしの見た限り誰も購入してなかったです。
なのでiPhoneやWi-Fiなど濡れたくないものが入っているバッグごとビニール袋に入れといたら良かったなと思います。下着までビショビショに濡れましたがすぐ乾きました。
カウントダウンの花火はハリウッドエリアで見られると聞いていたのですが、ハリウッドのどの場所かまで確認しておいた方が良いです。
夜も遅くなると園内にも人が少ないので余裕を持っていたのですが、実際花火のエリアに行くと「一体どこからこんなにたくさんの人が、、？」というくらいに人がぎゅうぎゅうで入れなくて、花火をあまり見られませんでした(写真参照:エリア内に入れなければ屋根や木が視界を邪魔して花火の全体像が見えないのです)

それでも、たくさんのアトラクションに乗れて最高の思い出しかありません

わたしたち夫婦はWi-Fi1台をシェアしていたので子供が身長制限で乗れない場合は一人はシングルライド、もう一人ははぐれないようにその場で子供と待機だったのですが、もし一人一台Wi-Fiがあれば連絡を取り合えるので、待機の時間に他のアトラクションに子供と乗ったりカフェに入ったりという選択肢も増えるなと思いました。
(各アトラクションの待ち時間表示は当てになりません！なので何分後に待ち合わせとかは難しい)

楽しすぎてお腹が空くのも忘れて遊んだのでレストランは利用してないのですが、再入場も出来るらしいので一度外に出て食事しても良いと思います。

The day started in a very crowded and chaotic 'VIP lounge' so busy there wasn't a place to sit and I stood filling out the paperwork being jostled by people. The two of us were paired with a family of three, who were very nice, but were interested in different things to us (we wanted to do all the thrillseeker rides and not interested in shopping, photo ops or kid stuff).

Our guide Man Xuan was excellent. Not only did she arrange our day based on what we wanted to do, she held our bags while we went on rides, made sure we got the best seats, and made suggestions for things to do, where to eat and where to sit at the activities based on our preferences. The longest we waited for a ride was for the previous one to end and this is why the VIP price was completely worth it. 

We were at the park for 6 hours (10-4) and the guide was with us for the entire time, except for a lunch break. In that time we went on every ride we wanted, Transformers and the roller coasters were excellent and we loved the hilariously enjoyable Shrek 4D show. It's a small park but we couldn't have done everything we wanted without the 'skip all the queues' VIP pass. The other family left the tour for a couple of hours to go and do things they wanted to do, which is probably not ideal when you have paid for VIP. 

I'd never been to a theme park before and wasn't sure I'd like it but absolutely loved it!

But then the ques became quite long and there was no staff to manage the line or direct people as there was confusion about what was express line and regular line  (E.g. sesame street). Also staff were letting just 2 people onto 4 seater carriage and so some rides were not being used to full capacity despite 1 hour wait. I think some revision of how ques are managed is required as no one really wants to wait an hour for a ride that lasts less than 5 mins.

Our 7 yo is not into roller coasters or high rides so after about 3 hours we were done and I left feeling underwhelmed.

(Ungeachtet der Tatsache dass der Park bei uns relativ leer war - und ungeachtet dass es Nachmittag geschüttet hat wie aus Eimern und einige Attraktionen daraufhin aus Sicherheitsgründen geschlossen wurden - dafür kann ja der Park nichts!)

Der Park ist insgesamt ca halb so groß würde ich schätzen, aber für Familien perfekt um das ohne Hektik an einem gemütlichen Tag zu erledigen. Das Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis ist absolut ok.  Zum Thema ""Abzocke"" was hier einige bemängeln ein paar kleine Hinweise (Freizeitparks sind immer etwas teurer, ABER): Wir hatten ein paar Sandwiches und Getränke mitgenommen und direkt in der Mall (wo die Monorail abfährt) an einem der zahlreichen ""Fressbuden"" ausgiebig gegessen....das hat alles für den ganzen Tag gereicht, wir haben keinen einzigen $ im Park ausgegeben - außer eben dem Eintritt.

Ich würde auf keinen fall diesen Fast-pass kaufen, wenn man mal anstehen muß, dann gehört das denke ich dazu.

3,739948741,2020-01-18,OTHER,4,"Armed with express passes, our family of four (including two kids, aged 11 and 8) spent a mostly enjoyable day here, in January 2020. It must be said that the park itself - whilst held aloft by a number of truly exceptional rides - is actually quite small... and lacks the depth of thrill rides that one would find at say a Six Flags park in the US. 

That said, the rides at the upper echelon of this park are sensational. The first we attacked was Transformers... and what an experience that was. After lining up for 20 odd minutes (even with express passes), this ride did not disappoint. Dizzying video animation, combined with a moving cart makes for a truly unique experience. Hard to explain how effectively stomach-churning some of the 'drops' were... even though you knew the sensation was mostly created by video screens. An absolute must.

After that, I (the others were too scared) braved the Battlestar Galactica: Cylon roller coaster. Just. WOW. As the veteran of many theme parks in my time, this suspended coaster is right up there with the world's best and is - for mine - THE must-do ride in the park. Worth the price of admission alone. The acceleration up the initial climb, and subsequent drop is utterly unbelievable... and the fast loop towards the end of the ride (where you dive into the excavated trench - was sublime. It was so good that I made a point of lining up again, towards the end of the day, just to experience it one more time before leaving. Just as good the second time. Top 3 best coasters I've been on, ever.

I also took a ride on Battlestar Galactica: Human coaster with my 11 year old daughter. Was actually surprised how good this one was too, even without any loops or rolls. The speed (it's slightly faster than Cylon) and tight turns were hair-raising... and we had an absolute blast, laughing and whooping all the way.

The other ride of mention here is the Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure. Despite the lengthy queue (even with express passes, we still needed to line up for 40+ minutes), our whole family thought this was particularly great, and ended up suitably soaked afterwards. Not exactly a thrill ride (although the last bit was definitely thrilling for the kids), but a great family experience.

Other than that, the depth of quality rides thins out a tad. Still plenty to do for younger kids, but not so much so, for those seeking mass adrenaline release (even though what is there, is very, very good).

Мы покупали экспресс-проход, поэтому до обеда всё обошли, вышли за территорию пообедать пельмешками (рядом со входом в парк есть ресторан сети Din Tai Fung - там ооооочень вкусно! их по городу 20 заведений - обязательно зайдите) и вернулись, чтобы по второму разу посетить те аттракционы, которые особо понравились. Очень довольны, что купили Экспресс-проход - надо заранее покупать, онлайн. Потому что ""день в день"" может не быть - их продают ограниченное количество, чтобы очередь не превышала 10-15 минут (по обычной очереди на Мумию и Трансформеры была очередь 50-60 минут). К слову, система отметок Экспресс-билетов очень странная - думали, будут считывать штрих-код, но нет - контролер просто ручкой вычеркивал аттракцион, который посещен (по экспресс-проходу только один раз можно пройти).

Нет нужды бронировать на входе шкафчик на день за 15 синг долларов - на большинстве аттракционов при входе есть шкафы, где можно оставить рюкзак, шлепки, очки... На ""мумии"" - шкафы с отпечатком пальца, по которому бесплатно закрываются вещи на 40 минут. Если больше - доплата 1 или 2 доллара.

- eat before you go in. You’ll be starving anyway if you try to go event half of the attraction, but if you already eat outside, you might not by so much inside, because the price is very high in my view. 
- lots of water fountain, you can sip. Or maybe fill your Universal Tumblers (its good merchandise though)

Generally with Express pass one tends to get into rides immediately. Please do remember to do Transporter ride as it is a Must ride. Also do remember to also attend the WaterWorld Show at 1530/1730. Pls do remember to carry water bottles as you can use them and refill them at various locations. Remember to reach early at the venue 0930-1000. Toilets too are available throughout the park. Pls carry sunscreen, caps & shades to beat the sun. Be prepared to walk a lot and wear comfortable walking shoes. For Waterworld show if you sit in front, there are chances that you might get wet. If possible do carry sandwiches with you for energy booster. Ticket Prices & Universal Express Pass are expensive. Express Pass should only be purchased during peak tourist season.

We took express ticket and still had to wait upto 90 mins for the rides - why to take express tickets(?) and pay significantly more, when there is no upside to it. Worse is in certain situations the express queues were longer(!).

Secondly, USS needs to think about the footfall. Clearly, in order to make money, they do not cap the number of guests whom the tiny, little USS park can accommodate. What we saw was a clear failure of USS to deliver the experience tourists come for. 

Lastly, the rides were shut mid-day on account of some drizzle. I totally understand that it is for our safety. But then there was no clarity on when they will start the rides. As a result, a lot of people were stuck in stuffy rooms trying to get a chance to ride. Looking at their sufferings and total lack of clarity from USS on when the rides will resume, I felt that I should NOT have come to this place at all. It is not the money which i lost (which ofcourse I feel bad about) but what i saw in those waiting rooms that made me feel far more worse.

We knew it would be crowded but had to go while the cousins were visiting. We shouldn't have!  It was ridiculously crowded. We assumed we could just buy express passes for the day. Splurge on the fast pass. But when we went to buy the express pass it turned out to be more than DOULBE the cost of the ticket to get in. So we didn't buy them. But then spent the day irritated at the express pass line. ha ha.  Because they'd put the express pass people on 2 or 3 full coasters before loading the regular lane. EVERY ride was 2 hours or more. It was ridiculous. Sometimes we are at theme parks where the best ride is that long, but yesterday was just frustrating. Nothing felt worth the long lines. 2.5 hours for transformers. A really cool ride that we love, but by the end of 2.5 hours in line, nobody cares anymore. Everyone is tired and irritated. The ride doesn't feel quite as cool after THAT long of a wait. The whole experience was made even more irritating because the times on the map on the APP were totally off. The times at the rides were often off. Many rides posted times a good 20 minutes LESS than the time it actually took. On the map on the APP it would say 30 minutes. So we ran to ride Human. It took 80 minutes. Human is NOT worth 80 minutes. It's a regular rollercoaster. SO not worth a long wait. Cylon rollercoaster was AWESOME and is worth a long wait. We waited 2 hours and had SO much fun on it, it made the wait feel almost worth it. Human was NOT worth it!  The kids were excited all day to go on Jurassic Park. We waited all day for the line to go down. Even at 8:30pm it was still a 100 minute wait and so it was going to have to be the last ride. The kids were disappointed to not ride but opted to go ride a couple of other rides instead of waiting so long yet AGAIN, for just that 1 ride. We did about 4 rides in 8 hours. At 2:30pm we tried to stop for lunch. Every place completely packed so we got corndogs at a stand. At about 5:45 we finally stopped to get some real food. In Jurassic Park area my brother had gone an hour earlier to find and save us tables and we ate potato wedges and chicken satays that were actually quite good. And we got to sit for a while. We never did get to see Madagascar land or minion land or shrek land. We didn't get to go to any shows. Because we spent ALL DAY in lines.  The expresspass price at this park increases as more express passes sell. In other words, it's affordable if you are the first ones to buy the expresspass for that date. But if you wait until a few days before, it becomes ridiculously expensive. It is definitely NOT an amusement park worth hundreds of dollars! The firework show at the end was really nice. Well done! The APP is terrible. the lines were NOT worth it. As others have said, only go to this park on a weekday during off season. It's just not worth it on a holiday. Also, it was really annoying that they never had single rider lane open. I'm not sure why not???? i thought maybe there was a good reason until I was looking at the ""rollercoaster"" pictures of several rides after we'd ridden them and noticed that every coaster car would have several empty seats. And they weren't filling them with single riders???  strange!  AND the workers were NOT loading people into lanes, for quick loading of the rides. The ride would pull up and unload and the workers were just then ushering people into lanes. Then loading them. it would all go a lot faster if they had people in lanes READY to load right when the coaster car pulled up and emptied. Like other theme parks we've visited. And having fast passes like Disney or a functioning APP would be great. We live in JB across the border in Malaysia and thought about buying a season pass.

3,735762020,2019-12-30,OTHER,3,"First, the positive: this park is very different from the one in Hollywood. For that reason, this was a unique experience. The staff were mostly friendly. 
Getting there was convenient and the surrounding resort has a lot of options. 
That said, the guest experience is particularly lacking due to structural issues (especially regarding their queue system). 

It's clear that Universal Studios Singapore places a greater emphasis on its profit margin than it does on guest experience; this is not surprising (it's a business after all) but notable considering the effort its competitor (Disney parks, specifically) places on ensuring its guests don't feel gipped and get their money's worth. 

Wait Times: Expect to wait at least 40 minutes for each ride, even if the wait time displayed is significantly less. The display is almost never accurate and sometimes feels deliberately misleading. Here's an example: 

The Mummy ride showed a wait time of 25 minutes. Locker rentals nearby are free for 45 minutes, and at least $4 once that's exceeded. Thinking we'd be able to make it in and out of The Mummy in time, we placed our possessions in the locker and immediately went into the line. 
The wait ended up being an hour long, and we ultimately had to pay to get our items out of the locker. 
--

The 'skip the line' pass they sell on top of the admission ticket to the park is the only real way to avoid the long waits. Unfortunately due to every single ride having an express line, non-express users are completely screwed regardless of what they want to do, and there's no reliable way to efficiently maximize your time. 

--

Attractions are average and generic; the Puss in Boots Giant Journey ""roller coaster"" (it does not deserve being called such) was particularly disappointing.
Food inside the park was overpriced; you'd be much better off exiting the park and eating somewhere else in the Sentosa resort. 

--
Ultimately, this is a park you don't need to revisit once you've experienced it. Until they rework their queue system so that guests don't feel like second-class citizens if they don't pay the premium skip the line feature, I think I've got the gist of the place and won't be returning.","Unless you pay a premium, you'll be waiting in lines 90% of your day.",2019-12-01,NONE,Jason T,"Los Angeles, California",Los Angeles,California,0

However we didn’t expect two out of the first four rides we tried to be closed with maintenance issues ( both opened later with massive queues); food stalls lacking basic provisions; tired and rundown finish on buildings and footpaths; queues of over 140 minutes for certain rides. We paid SG$960 (usd700)  for four adult tickets including unlimited fast pass. (We tried to buy them online to get residents’ and student discounts but none of the selections fitted our situation, so after queuing for 30 mins we had to pay full price for all).We were there seven hours and went on seven attractions. Is this good value? Not in my book. 

A lot of external fittings are showing their age and corrosion is rife in many areas. I would like to assume that vital systems are better maintained. 

The restaurant we went to essentially threw the cold (supposed to be hot) food at us. Staff had no interest in discussing issues, due either to limited English or a lack of interest.. We live in Singapore and had not been to Universal for years, due to relative mediocrity last time. After this experience, not only will we not return, but we will now also advise others to avoid, hence this post. If you must visit: 1. Buy tickets online if you can; 2. Avoid any holiday. 3.

We purchased tickets from the Changi Rewards website, which had to be exchanged upon arrival to USS. The signposting is poor, compounded by the sheer number of visitors to the park obscuring what limited signage there is.

We queued up for 40 minutes before finally exchanging our vouchers for passes. I can only imagine how long people who were in line were waiting for - there were at least 10-12 rows about 40-50 people deep.

We got to the Battlestar Galactica: Cylon ride where we waited for 90 minutes in the standard queue before getting onto the ride. The ride itself was fine, and not dissimilar to how it was when the park first opened.

Stopped for a quick toilet break after and the toilets left much to be desired. Broken toilet seats and wet floors - not exactly an impression of consistent and clean maintenance.

Unfortunately the theme of maintenance does not appear to be a strong suit here. We moved on to the Mummy ride next and where the USS experience continued to disappoint. We waited for 57 minutes in a sweltering queue with very limited air conditioning or even ventilation, only to be told that the ride had to be “urgently evacuated”, leaving a throng of disgruntled visitors. 

We are currently in line for the Jurassic Park Rapids ride ... with a wait time of 2 hours.

Clearly USS is aware of the exceedingly excessive wait times as it has introduced both express and express unlimited passes. These are quite pricey and we’re listed for SGD$110 and SGD$140 on the day of our visit. Even so, the express lines on the day of our visit were not much shorter - maybe an hour or so less than the regular line and it was clear from the disappointed looks on the express pass holders that this was not the premium experience they had paid for. 

Having been to Universal Studios Japan in June 2019, which undeniably has greater drawcard attractions like Harry Potter World and provided a fantastic experience, it seems a let-down that USS cannot provide anywhere close to a similar experience. Yes the wait times for popular rides at USJ were at times comparable (we waited 2 hours at the start of the day for the Harry Potter ride), but these wait times were remarkably reduced towards the late afternoon and there was always a sense of calm ensuring visitor comfort whilst waiting  for each ride.There were also many more food carts and kiosks to stock up on whilst waiting. There were unfortunately more closed kiosks/carts than open on the day we visited. 

USS provides a far inferior experience and its infrastructure and commitment to a positive visitor experience appears to have succumbed to the pressures of maximising visitor numbers, with no regard to how it can actually service these guests.

All in all, it is a resounding disappointment not only from myself but from a friend visiting from overseas who remembers USS from better days.

We were welcomed into the VIP reception and offered cold drinks and was introduced to our guide for the day Cassandra. Our VIP tickets had pictures of Minions on which I had put down as a request for a meet and greet. It was little touches like this that helped make our day. Cassandra offered us a map of the park and explained what we would do in the tour and booked our meet and greet sessions. Cassandra explained that another family might join us (as the tour can have up to 12 people) however we weren't phased by this. Our first part was only the 3 of us and then the other family joined us.

The VIP Experience allowed us to walk straight onto the rides, even rides that aren't included in the unlimited express tickets. We were the first to do our meet and greets - we choose Transformers and Minions. The tickets included unlimited passes so after the tour finished we were able to choose which rides we wanted to back onto plus a $25 meal voucher per person.
We went on 9 rides plus the adults were offered the opportunity to go onto the Battlestar Galactica. There was a VIP room at the Waterworld show which was welcoming with a cold drink. I highly recommend the pizzas at the Italian place, they are huge and filled our family of 3.
We had booked the 10am tour and it finished at 4pm as the guide has an hour lunch break during the day.
Cost wise it worked out only slightly more expensive than purchasing the entry ticket, unlimited pass plus the $25 per person food. The ticket was slightly discounted due to a promotion they had on if you pay for the VIP tickets via a Mastercard.

If you want to have a good day at Universal Studios, go to the one in America. 

The Singapore Universal Studios is small, outdated and extremely overcrowded, not to mention, ridiculously expensive for what it offers.

We spent most of our day here in queues, just lining up in the heat waiting for a sub-par ride or attraction. The worst part is that Universal charges you an exorbitant fee for an ""express pass"" to cut the queue. These suckers who have paid an arm and a leg are guaranteed to ride A LOT and maybe you do get value for money for this pass. However, if you didn't pay for this pass (which is the majority of tourists), you're stuck in line watching these guys skip the line over and over again before your line has even moved one person.

There were regular, unexplained delays in the rides with no warning on how long the wait time would be for the ride to be operational again. 

The attractions are so outdated... For example, the Waterworld special effects show... Not only is Waterworld a terrible movie to begin with, but it's from 1995! Families with young children wouldn't even know this movie. Then there's the Battlestar Galactica rollercoasters - sure it was a relatively popular Sci-Fi show in 2004, however, that's 15 years ago... Not appealing to the young audience of children who frequent the park.

Then there's the locker scam. Sure, the lockers are free for a certain time period when you go on a ride, but you may end up paying more money if you get stuck in a line for hours and can't decide if it's worth the sacrifice to leave the line or stay in it since you've been there for so long.

Oh, and we went on a Monday and spent the whole day in lines, only riding 4 attractions... Apparently weekends are even worse...

Overall, don't bother! It's not value for money and there are better things to see and do with your time in Singapore.","If you like lining up for hours on end, this is the place for you!",2019-10-01,NONE,Vortex,,,,-1

The park is not that big to be honest and if this is your first time then you will probably enjoy the experience there. But if you have visited before and experience all the rides and shows, then it will be kind of boring because it’s the same thing. 

The transformers ride is excellent and fun. Too bad they are still using the same story and did not change it with another new storyline.

We did pre-book our tickets online, so there was no queuing up just turned up at the entrance.

There were some really good parts about and some disappointing bits. Suppose best to deal with the good bits first.

Transformers the Ride, was our first a 3D in the dark, glasses were provided before boarding, this was definitely worth queuing for.

Accelerator was like a adults teacup ride, a bit of fun.

We queued for about 45 minutes to ride on Battlestar Galactica Cyclon, this was white knuckle and lots of screaming.

Did like the Sesame Street and other statues around the place.

Return of the Mummy was one of the attractions we had highlighted that we would like to experience.

The first time we visited we were told the attraction was closed, we were given no indication for how long.

Rather that wait around in the hope that the ride would open soon, we decided to continue to visit other attractions and return here later.

Over a lengthy interval of time we returned here twice only to find the attraction remained closed. The staff there could not say when it was likely to reopen.

Rather disappointingly we decided to give it a miss as it was not likely to reopen on the day.

There was lots of areas covered in black cloth which were being made ready for Halloween.

The Battlestar Galactica Human Ride, the waiting time never changed from 90 minutes, so we did not bother.

We found the Shops around the Park, Big Bird's Emporium, Hello Kitty Studio, Minion Mart, Universal Store and others were grossly over priced.

There are lots of attractions inside that were also not present / not available in Hollywood the time I visited last year. So for instance, I enjoyed the Transformers 3D because I didn't get the chance to do that before. Not all rides were the same so I really enjoyed the Rides & Attractions as well here in SG. Planning ahead on what to do is really important to maximize the visit. Me and my sis did skip just a few rides that we're really scared of but we almost rode everything. And since we skipped some, we were able to do more of the Meet & Greet events, as well as the Shows available. It was also a great time to visit since it's Christmas season and most shows were themed with Christmas Vibes. There were probably just 1-2 Shows and Meet & Greets that we were not able to take photos with due to cutoff times (after we lined up also, for a little bit). The fan mists were not working and could've probably been turned off instead. It was not that hot but it was still humid, despite a few times it drizzled that day of our visit. Good thing it didn't rain that much, unlike the previous day we were in SG. However, it could be better if more fans were turned on. Best also for visits to happen on weekdays. It was still packed when we visited (on a Wednesday) and at times, we still had to use our ""Universal Express Tickets"" (we bought separately) since there are queue lines - like at the Transformers Attraction, The Pandages Theatre (showing Elmo Time when we visited - lotsa kids & families), Jurrasic park attractions, among others. It could've been better as well if all attractions were following the policies on Universal Express. There were times wherein they treated those with Express and those without it, as same. Like at the ""Lights, Camera ..."" they made us all line up the same even if we had the Express Ticket and it was accepted there supposedly. My sis had the chance to perform with the dancers of the ""Rhythm Truck"" performance. We knew some of them from home - The Streetboys (which I believe is now called The Rockafellas?) and it was amazing! The closing show we saw (""The Christmas Invention"") was a spectacular attraction as well!

I was expecting the park to be busy as it is the school holidays in Singapore and the weather was good, but I was pleasantly surprised the park wasn't that crowded. I was at Universal Studios Hollywood earlier this year and the wait for rides are usually at least 30 to 40 minutes. The most I had to wait for rides today was 15 minutes. For the Battlestar Galatica, the posted wait time is usually 60 min. But at 5pm, the posted wait time was 5 minutes! I went on Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure in 5 minutes, the posted wait time was 15 minutes.

I'm not much into rides so I went on only a few, but there are many shows to watch. The shows were done really well and performers are all very professional. The mascot Julien from Madagascar did a fantastic job. He's an absolute joy to watch! Staff are helpful and friendly. Don't miss the Waterworld show.

In preparation for our day out at USS, we bought the fast-track passes which more than earned their keep as the wait times for some rides were around forty minutes plus.

First of all, I don't mind spending more money, if what offered to me is worth it, for example if I'm enjoying the park, I would definitely buy something to cherish my memory. But that wasn't the case, because the whole atmosphere didn't make me want to spend more.

- The park is small, the attractions are small and short
- The decorations felt poorly made compared to other theme parks, so the atmosphere was lacking
- Most staffs don't seem to bother to entertain the visitors, I mean they are helpful keeping people in order and in line, and that's it. In theme parks, I expect much more, or at least, they should be smiling and making us feel happy
- Merchandises are limited and the quality didn't appeal to me. I am a huge Elmo fan, but there wasn't a Elmo merchandise I would like to add to my collection
- Food wasn't good either

Since they marketed it as ""one-of-its-kind theme park in Asia"", it was very disappointing, because it is extremely far from the truth. There are countless better theme parks in Asia and I expect much much more when it comes to Universal Studios. I think Transformers was the only good memory I have from this visit.

Wherever I go I always try to visit the theme park and this time I felt like I couldn't miss it. And it didn't disappoint!

The ticket is around 40 GBP and I would say that if you go in a weekday and non-holiday, you won't need a fast pass or anything else. 

It is quite bigger than Disneyland Tokyo, although if you rush it through, you will have finished the main attractions by midday. You will even have time to ride the main ones several times. 

What surprised me the most was the roller coaster ""Cylone"". I honestly wasn't expecting such an intense ride. I'm a fan of fast rides and so far the only ones that had me satisfied were in Port Aventura (Spain) but here, in Cylone, I found my favourite one. 

For people that don't love rides so much, the theme is also really nice and there are shows and activities like movies or really soft.

20,727940244,2019-11-21,OTHER,4,"Two years ago, I led a bus load of residents to this attraction for a fun and enjoyable night. This time I was tasked with the same assignment and I thought it would be very boring and monotonous to see the same old things again. 

As in previous year, we booked the entire Universal Studio for our residents from 6 pm to 11.30 pm. It was school holiday and the response to the ticket sale was overwhelming. All 3000 tickets were completely sold despite the fact that they came here 2 years ago and despite the fact that the price of one admission ticket has increased from $20/- to $30/-. 

About 70 buses were chartered to ferry the residents from the community center to the attraction. But the discounted ticket came with a price. It is just for a short few hours duration and few of the food outlets and play stations had closed. 

The Madagascar A Crate Adventure was not open 2 years ago but this time we were lucky to jump into the boat rides and almost got ourselves wet by the raining water.  The captivating and stunning water world performances appeared to me repetitive but I was attracted to a  photo studio where you can choose to put on few of the Korean costumes on display and be photographed. It was fun attired in baggy and brightly colored Korean costumes with my bus `mistresses' in a superimposed beautiful Korean scenery in the background. 

Unlike 2 years ago where I roamed in solo, this time I decided to walk around with my group of grassroots members. Knowing that the price of the food here is exorbitant, the 10 of us decided to combine all our individual food vouchers and bought for ourselves a big chicken pizza to share.  It was a good idea and everyone enjoyed the `sumptuous' feat of pizza while we laughed and talked happily at the table. 

Once stomach filled, we proceeded to have some fun with the ride at Sesame Street and watched a spectacular street hip hop dance near the corner. The pulsating music uplifted my spirit  and I almost danced with them. I was attracted to the twirling and whirling Accelerator but a warning risk signage dampened my excitement. I felt regret not participating in the thrill. We wanted to try the Transformers but was discouraged by the 20 minutes queue. 

We strolled around for a while and took some group photos with some of the cartoon characters before realizing that it was time to stand-by at the departing bus pick-up points for residents.

It was a short time spent but it was something different from the last time I came. The attraction seem small but there are many hidden treasures for you to explore. This time I felt happy to be in the company of my members as we explored the place. The last time I went on a solo rushing from one ride to another.

- Can the fountain be repaired at Sci-Fi city?
- Can New York's shopfronts be updated as some stuff has been sun damaged?
Incorporate more movie elements. (there is a Gotham reference but Batman is Warner? No?)
- Lights, camera, action: can the movie posters be updated please and give it a bit more sparkle. (at least give it a clean)
- There is a minion shop but no minion attraction? Minion fountain doesn't work either
- The lost world: great show! superb! 10/10! The decor is faded and props are poor. A few screens and a bit of sound goes a long way.
- Far Far Away: a small detail: I was expecting the ''Welcome to Duloc animation'' like in the movie. Shrek 4D and Donkey Live was great.
The enchanted airways: faded decor, could do with some screens and animation.
Puss in boots: great ride but what's up with the story line? Again, faded decor.
Madagascar: great decor and nice ride but could do with an animation upgrade.
Revenge of the mummy: superb overall. What a great decor, entrance has great atmosphere. A few of the animations didn't work during the ride.
Battlestar Galactica: Superb rides! But does anyone know actually the TV series? Is having a theme park not part of Universal Studios to promoted their franchises? 
Same with Jurassic Park rapid adventure: great ride but it needs updating as there are 5 movies in the franchise by now.

We also noticed that whilst on the previous visit there were plenty of film characters wondering around (Marilyn Monroe, Charlie Chaplin and Puss in Boots) available for photo opportunities, this time we only found someone in a red bird costume!

Only criticism was that whilst in the resorts design they have tried to make most attractions accessible to disabled people and the attraction staff try to assist then, as we left we noticed the staff at the gates making a guy with a walking stick walk to the far side of the entrance/exit gates rather than helping him by letting him out at the nearest gate.",Worth a visit but expensive,2019-10-01,FAMILY,Connoisseur2012,"Ampang, Malaysia",Ampang,Malaysia,0

We started with Elmo at 1230, and some other outdoor shows like turntables etc; then Donkey Live, Waterworld. By the time we were done it was 4. 

The only scheduled closure was for Transformers. We had saved our express pass UNLIMITED for Puss Inboots, Enchanted Airways etc; but made the mistake of going in Madagascar Crate adventure - whwre there was a technical issue . Since we had the express pass we were right in front of the ride and wasn’t sure if we should leave or stay. In the end the delay was AN HOUR! And by the time we were out it was a mad rush to finish the 2 other coasters Puss and Enchanted Airways. However for some reason Enchanfed Airways was closed!! No reason, nothing. We only managed one coaster before they already closed everything and didn’t allow us to queue for rides from 545pm onwards. This was even though the park was scheduled to close at 6pm. I bought the express pass unlimited for NOTHING.

The crowning failure was when a worker (should have taken her name)at the Far Far Away 4 D Shrek Animation slamming the 3D glasses when my sister asked her politely where to get the items. I was so shocked and enraged by her rude behaviour. There should be an announcement to the guests, get the 3D glasses before entering the so called “Torturing Dungeon”.  We are not tortured by the dungeon but pissed off by the rudeness of the said staff.
There was no proper ushered & direction. Guests bunched into the dungeon until announcement been made reminding to wear the 3D glasses for the show. The other scenario was guests are been hurrying in other words chased away when the meet and greet session has end its showtime. Definitely guests especially with children excited to take pictures of their favourite characters. But sadly they’ve been chased away unprofessionally. Is that how you treat your guests. To me these staff are not capable to work in amusement park industry. To work in a amusement park, you should be energetic, lively, cheerful and friendly to the guests. Not the other way round. 
In addition, the management of universal studios singapore should have a training session of their staff on how to improve a guests customers orientated satisfaction. The management should take seriously into the comfort of the guests while waiting and exhausted situation for the long queue at each park. Should have placed a giant mist fan, blowers and bench as your guests comprises a range of ages. Especially to the senior citizens and with small children. And also to look into how to resolve on the exhausted long queue issues. To create more lane perhaps or what not?

3,722755269,2019-10-31,MOBILE,5,"Great place and has rides to cater to young kids 5+yrs and adults. For smaller kids I think shows and merry go rounds are there. we went on a weekday during Diwali time and still got a lot of crowd. Would highly recommend to invest in the express pass to make best use of time and cover all rides in case going to weekend or holidays especially with impatient kids. Constraints on some rides are based on height and dimensions and health.

Some tips:
1. One ride at Jurassic park is a wet ride, you can get drenched, so carry change of clothes or buy the transparent raincoats called ponchos for 5SD if you don’t like to walk around all wet. Noon time is pretty hot here so better to be wet at this time. Also shoes will get soaked so wear flip flops or remove shoes.
2. Don’t spend too much time clicking pics or buying souvenirs initially as you may not have time for rides. Also note it closes sharp at 6pm and you tend to be bit tired by 4-5pm after all the rides, best time to walk slow and take pics. Whole place can be covered well within half hr on foot.
3. At first hoping you are early, Walk around , check and prioritise those rides which you like the most and have smaller queues and wait times. 
4. Some rides can have as long as 2hrs wait time like the galactica red and grey track and transformer so walk further from entrance and try and hit these rides first instead of going left to right along the circle which is what most of the crowd will be doing. Also most of the crowd will be clicking pics on entry so earlier the better to hit these rides.
5. The shows are at fixed times and not all shows are great. Research what you like and time the shows well ahead to ensure you don’t miss them. I liked the waterworld show, you can get wet here if you are in soak zone, would recommend to see the 12.15pm show. In the evening the entire crowd goes to see this amazing live stunt show with fire and guns and there will be no queues hopefully at the rides for a good 45mins which you can Utilise to your benefit. Take seats in this show as per your preference of getting wet or not.
6. For some rides you have to keep your bags in locker so travel as light as possible.
7. Carry hats umbrellas and sunglasses as place is very hot. At Roll-a-coaster like rides ensure you are not carrying or wearing at loose articles on you, like caps, mobiles, chains/necklaces, slippers etc. secure them well or remove them. Dress comfortably for the rides and hot weather.
8. Avoid rides which cause nausea immediately post lunch. Hit some shows or slow rides at this time.
9. Avoid lunch during peak times from 12 to 2pm, queues will less during this time, enjoy your rides instead.
10. Free Toilets are there. Also free drinking water is available at many points so carry your bottles.
11. The handlers of the rides are few and don’t rush in my opinion for ensuring all safety measures of the people on the rides are meet, so queues move a little slow. Also people having  express pass get first priority and no wait time at all so another reason why queues move slow.",Was fun but A day is not enough,2019-10-01,FAMILY,Prigyan,"Mumbai, India",Mumbai,India,1

As a work pass holder i was able to buy it for $69 others on $75 rates.

We decided to visit today (30th Nov 2019 Wednesday). Not Weekend. Not Holiday season at least for local school or nearby counties. 

Only risk was that we Singapore are notorious when it comes to rain. We started from North of Singapore it was already raining here. But fortunately Rain Gods favored us and moved the spell away from South and USS was safe.. None of the rides was cancelled. Rain in North gave us some good shade and cool breeze during the whole day.

Entry to USS.

- Got the Sentosa Express from VivoCity level 3. Payed $6 two way journey using MRT Card.
- We arrived around 2:30pm lol. (Horribly late on purpose to avoid morning rush hour Q. We had bought tickets online)
- Went straight to entry point, scanned email and got in. (they did not check bags for food or water) We had none anyways inside our backbag.
- Entry Q time 0mins

To End the day, late entry to Universal studio without express pass during non peak season, turned out to be ok. Q timing was min. If you are with company you wont know the time flying by. We missed couple of rides because of closure around 6:00pm. they had some corporate event taken over during evening. But again if we had come early we still would have to spend more time in Q. its a trade off.

Hope this has been informative to you. I will be back to enjoy the rest of the ride soon. ;)

oh by the way. food inside are priced $15 to $20 per person. you can just step out with reentry stamp and goto nearby 7/11 and get some awesome food for 3 people for $15 along with a drink. There are enough drinking pods near all rides.",Late Entry without Express Pass - Updated Queue timing,2019-10-01,NONE,DJontheMove,"Singapore, Singapore",Singapore,Singapore,1

Unfortunately this one just didn't live up to the ones in Japan or California. It was a lot smaller and the amount of attractions for the younger crowds was just not worth the amount of money we spent. Even my nine year old wasnt impressed. The good thing about this place however is that the lines weren't too long and it incorporated Shrek, Madagascar and Sesame Street. The Shrek castle ride was by far one of our favorites and a must ride. Super cute 4D theatre type thing.

The staff appeared to not enjoy themselves at all. The only staff that was somewhat happy were the ones who did the shows.

We bought express passes and they were absolutely worth their price (cheaper online than at the park). Most we waited was 20min and that was because a ride had been closed briefly. Most were a 5min at most wait.

Highlights - waterworld show. Just wow. Beware...splash zone is a soak zone. Spent quite a bit of time walking around soaking wet after that! Really amazing show, recommend!!
Transformers 4D was outstanding and the single riders line moves as fast as the Express pass line. At the end of the day the lines were shorter so I did this one again as it was so good.

The service culture is sorely lacking and please relook and retrain the staff that you hire- almost ALL are insipid and look like they are having the worse time of their lives.
-At the entrance, we were holding a balloon ( my toddler was holding on to it , was from Mcdonalds), the staff gave us a gloomy face and went- Balloons not allowed- there was no offer to take it  or help to dispose it for us etc...
We have been to many theme parks around the world and the front line service staff do not deliver / convey messages in this manner...I respect the rules that we cannot bring a balloon in, but the way it was conveyed??! 
Next, we decided to take the Sesame Street Spagethhi Ride, this was on the 19th Oct 2019 morning , the staff at the entrance, I managed to get his name as he was wearing a tag ' BHIM' , also gave the most sour looking face, he got my son to take his height to make sure he could take the ride ( but yeah no smiles, no words at all....it was almost like he couldnt speak English, and when i asked him a question about the ride, he did not reply too )....PLEASE USS, hire staff that can understand or least speak English?!
Lastly, we went for lunch at Discovery cafe and I witnessed a really rude staff member shouting at a old lady and her helper to ""MOVE""- no tact at all ....granted it was crowded, the message could have been delivered nicely?!
In addition, the $13 chicken rice and fish soup was the nastiest food I've eaten...

Very convenient so that we didn't have to queue at the attractions which were always crowded. You can buy them also online but I'm not sure if you have reductions. We visited Universal Studios on Monday  and it was a good choice as it rained just when we were about to leave the park at 6pm. Even if expensive we bought the unlimited fast pass inside the park at a shop near the entrance (80 $ not fixed price as changes every day) so we could access all the attractions. Probably the one time fast pass could have been enough for us (cheaper than the unlimited, 50$ on that day). We took a map and day's events list and decided what we didn't want to miss : the Sesame Trick or Treat show (20 minutes) was really appreciated by the 8 years old boy, and the hip-hop street dancers not far away from the first exhibition.

4,717474161,2019-10-11,MOBILE,1,"I am a Singaporean and I am concerned on writing a bad review for USS. It’s my 4th or 5th visit to USS, and all previous visits are good, but I can’t help but feel that their focus on bringing smiles have gone off track over the years... Hope this review will give make the management team rethink their strategies.

My recent visit is horrible, 5 hours and just 1 ride + badly over priced food. Totally spoiled my 5 year anniversary with my wife.

Day started at 10am, observed an argument at the gates between USS staff and a group of tourists. It might be the issue with the group of tourists, but the way things were handled by USS staffs is disappointing. Huge crowds of queue resulted from the saga and unhappiness can be observed even on by standers.

Since it’s not our first time in USS, we went straight to the biggest ride. Aimed for the Human ride as it says 15mins wait. Ended the wait was 35mins before I first catch a glimpse of the ride. As unlucky as it can be, the ride faced technical problems at this moment. And it took next 20mins of troubleshooting before they announce there is an issue. I pity the people in the queue behind me, as they are in the queue without any information. Since We are right at the front of the queue, we decided to hold on, and luckily the ride resumed after 15mins. I have to say the USS employees did not handle the situation at all, and not the least apologetic. I don’t expect them to bow like the Japanese, but no communication and simply ignoring the crowd wouldn’t make things better. It is almost like the breakdown has nothing to do with them. Ofcourse they didn’t cause it, but they don’t feel the ownership of the USS brand in their work at all.

Next, we went for lunch. The steak place we planned to go was closed for private event, after we walk so far to reach it. It’s just our bad luck, but it could have helped if such info was provided on the web or near the entrance. Moving on, we ate SGD13 chicken rice and SGD5 coke each... totally unsatisfying and overpriced... this may be the norm, but I can’t help to be pissed...

After lunch, we went straight to the mummy ride, again 15mins wait posted at the entrance. Went in, only see the ride after 40mins. Dejavu.... the ride is down... and waited another 30mins before they announced the breakdown... (see image for photo of tired waiting people) this time, I didn’t wait just left the place. I hate to think that I took a day off from work and paid almost SGD160 just for all these service. Got out and faced another challenge at the locker area, as people crowd around the lockers demanding the locker attendant to unlock. Note: free locker is only first 45mins, any longer you are charged. People are squeezing in and for locking and unlocking stuffs, and it is Chaos!!! 1 old man trying to unlock lockers one by one, other USS staffs passing by just said they can’t help, need to wait for the old man. They sure have the attitude of this isn’t my problem. The same thing happened in my first ride, but at the mummy area is way more chaotic due to small space. Not to mention, we noticed that the entrance USS staffs don’t even know the ride is broken, and they allow more riders to enter to queue.

That was it, and we went straight to guest service to demand my money back. It was successful, but not until we have to hear the staff preaching about how the rides breakdown is not within their control and we can go for other rides. I lost my anger a little and told the staff that breakdowns can be under control via proper maintenance (I run a production plant, and equipment management is not new to me).

Finally after 5 hours, we got out of USS having just taken 1 ride and ate some lousy and expensive lunch. Fortunately, Vivo City Mall redeemed the day, else our anniversary will end in the worse way possible.",Wasted Day Out!,2019-10-01,COUPLES,Chenghong,Singapore,,Singapore,-1

Each themed enclosure would have a unique ride in terms of water sport or roller coaster along with a 4 D show and live performances.

The space roller coaster and the Egyptian roller coaster are not for the faint hearted.

The 4D movie on Shrek is good and the Waterworld live performance is simply Hollywood.

A few things that were frustrating where a few of the rides required no bags / hats phones etc.. meaning you had no choice but have 1 person sit off or hire a locker.

Plenty of shops to buy merchandise from and at the 6 oclock mark when you are being bearded out of the park the shops are nuts.

The park was full therefore waiting time for rides were long and quite disorganized.  For the Mummy Ride for example,  they used the ""Single Rider"" queue for Express Pass holders without additional signages, so some Single Riders who queued have to head to the exit and queue again (what an inconvenience) furthermore,  after queuing for 30 minutes they closed the ride.  I believe some unforseen breakdown might occur however they can look onto more stringent preventive maintenance so as not to affect their patrons.  
Another very disappointing experience - the photo-taking with the characters (statues) of Madagascar,  Sesame Street,  etc.  I appreciate they have the ropes for orderly queues,  they have official photographers stationed but they didn't allow us to take photos with our own cameras or handphones.  They anyhow took photos using our phones with a maximum of 2 shots ONLY.  It's like forcing us to buy the photos they took.  This was not the system previously and besides,  we paid for the entrance to the park which includes all the attractions and photo spots.  So why will they prohibit photo taking?

3,713193776,2019-09-26,MOBILE,4,"We arrived at about 9.15 and had to convert our booking confirmation into a ticket at guest services (hard to find as the ticket booths are set out in front, blocking it). We were in the queue by half 9 and they started letting people in by about 10 to 10. We headed straight for Cylon and only had to wait 5 minutes then went to Human and had about a 10 minute wait. Cylon is much more of a ‘thrill ride’ than Human. Mummy was then only about a 15 minute wait. Definitely worth getting there early! When we got off Mummy it still said 15 mins so we decided to do it again. However it ended up being much longer and we therefore were charged for having our belongings in the locker for over 45 minutes. It wouldn’t open our locker until we’d paid yet obviously all of our money/cards were inside the locker as you weren’t allowed anything on you! Took ages to find a member of staff and we were charged $4 even though the queue time was wrong..: ridiculous system. The lockers for human/Cylon seemed to be more up to date and the time you were allowed changed based on queue times - much better system.
The queues after this were longer, longest wait was about an hour.
Do single rider where you can. We did for canopy flyer and Jurassic park and we ended up going very close together so didn’t have to wait around for each other. This meant we queued for about 10-15 minutes for Jurassic park rather than 110. It want obvious that there was a single rider queue so make sure to ask.
We kept checking Cylon throughout the day (on the app as well as at the ride - not always completely accurate but better than nothing) and were waiting for it to reduce. At 6.45 it said only 30 mins and we thought we might even be able to do another ride after before the park shut at 8. However it took over an hour. Think they had a problem with the ride and by the time we got there they only had 1 running rather than 2. However in the time we queued, those with express passes got on the ride about 3 times! Seeing as an express pass would’ve cost us $110 each (even buying in advance), it is unfair that they get so much priority.

We easily spent all day here and just managed to get around all the rides and a couple of shows. 

The park is very well designed, goes in a circle.

My suggestion is to get on all the big roller coasters first as the wait time when we were there was 40 minutes compared to 5 minutes when the park first opened. 

We didn’t experience long lines, the longest was about 30 minutes for a child friendly ride.  Our child was free entry due to age so my suggestion is if you are travelling with young children upgrade the adult tickets to priority so your young isn’t waiting for long for you to come off the big rides, you’ll get on rides a lot quicker.  We were told we just missed the peak season.

We went on the rapid ride where the warning was you’ll get wet even soaked our experience yes we got wet but it wasn’t soaked. We didn’t bring rain coats / ponchos and decided to do this at the end of the day. If this is a problem make sure you bring ponchos, you can buy them at the park at a cost of $5

We were travelling with three autistic children so I am quite aware of observing how many accessibility options are available at this type of tourist venue.  There was not a specific disability queue for entry or any kind of quiet/sensory maps or information provided.

We attended the park outside of peak season and school holidays and found the lines for all the rides ridiculously long.  A lot of the rides we did try seemed dated/old.  The Shrek related 4D movie was interesting but it has a very long build up in an earlier room in which patrons are required to stand for at least 10 minutes.  This is not mentioned in the signage and there were no options provided for disabilities.  It was also poorly organised where people were put i haphazard lines manually then when the doors opened for entry everyone rushed forward, losing all trace of imagined lines we were placed in.

5,709555545,2019-09-13,MOBILE,4,"Love the different rides that suit the different age groups. Our kids 5, 7 and 9 were quite entertained. We have been annual pass holders for several years and here's some tips to share to survive the day with young kids:
1) go early. Q starts as early as 9am. It helps to be first few in the Q as you can wait for an hour for some popular rides. Get a spouse to take turns to Q while kids can play at the fringe (water fountain, chocolate store, sometimes fringe game stores, etc etc)
2) go straight for transformer with older kids (Q can become 60min later in the day). Followed by the 2 rollar coaster rides and mummy ride (all which can have long waiting time). Go for single rider if the Q starts to form. 
3) if follow the above it would be around 1045 to 1055. Then standby outside Jurassic world (which opens at 11am). A natural queue will usually normally form but there is no need/point to Q. You just stand behind the rope (as directed by staff). Then go for the dino boat ride and canopy flyer. 

By now, you would have cleared all the rides that normally you would need to wait for more than 1/2h. Spend the afternoon doing all the shows (e.g. Lights Camera Action, Sesame street, Shrek etc etc ) - weather is very hot in Singapore. Last hour you can go for the dragon ride if you have missed it (not much Q by then) and Madagascar boat ride (no Q by that time).  

If kids are not old enough to sit mummy ride and big roller coasters but are tall enough for the dragon and puss in boots rollar coaster then go for that when it opens (both rides also tend to have long waiting time during the day).

Food wise. A lot of options but very pricey and unhealthy. Nothing very suitable for young children and they don't allow us to bring in food, even snack bread or grapes for the kids. Yes, I was told to rent a locker outside to put my kids' grapes (of course we refused and ate it up on the spot - it was just a small box). There are many food options outside. However, if you have no particular food restrictions then it is fine.

2,709498173,2019-09-13,MOBILE,5,"Universal Studios Singapore is an adventurous and exciting outing sure to thrill the whole family.

The Battlestar Galactica roller coasters are fantastic, and well worth mustering your courage to experience.

The food, beverages, gift shops, and professional photography services are as over-priced as you’d expect at a theme park, but that’s part of the charm (and worth budgeting for).

The Waterworld stunt show is extremely impressive and entertaining. Definitely worth seeing.

Lockers:
We recommend renting a property locker at the main entrance, if you turn right immediately after entering the gate, rather than the lockers near attractions within the park.

2,709486912,2019-09-13,OTHER,5,"The park is smaller than other parks in the USA and Japan, but it was still great to visit.  The rides were great and so were the staff.  All very polite and friendly, as you would expect in the all the Universal Studio Parks.  Definitely glad I went, and I would probably go again if given the opportunity.  It was very easy to get too.  We used a mixture of taxi's and public transport.  If staying in Marina Bay (like we did), it is a short taxi ride.  Food options and merchandise was great.  Lots of options and the gift stores were fully stocked.  

As for peoples complaints in previous reviews.  Yes it is hot and humid, but you probably should have noted this before booking your trip to Singapore.  Coming from Australia, we had a slight advantage as the weather is the same as our summer.  All travellers should check the weather before planning your trips.  If you don't like/cannot stand hot and humid weather, don't book a trip to a place where the seasons are hot and hotter.  Make sure you are prepared for the day out.  Wear loose clothing and a hat when outdoors, comfortable shoes, bring a water bottle, and a fan or umbrella if you want too.  

And complaining about queues is a little dim.  Its a theme park that is very popular with a wide range of age groups.  Yes there will be queues.  If you don't want to line up for a roller coaster or to get a photo with your favourite character.  I suggest going in non-peak periods of the year or time of day, or upgrade your tickets to use the fast pass options.  You could also do like my husband and I, and use the single rider lines.  Often they are less than half the wait of the normal line, and the ride will be the same no matter who you sit next to.

The highlight for me was the Mummy and the Jurassic Park section.  Water World is also very cool.
Staff were friendly.  Many food options, though not a lot of options in each individual restaurant.  On a  friday in September, queues were long, but not more than an hour in most cases.  Single rider line helps.  If you dont see a single rider line, ask staff about it.  Many times I was asked if I was solo and sent up the Express lane with a special 'single rider' ticket.  This saved me loads of time standing in line.
Some of the attractions could you use a fresh coat of paint (Jurassic park seemed far too dated already for a park this new).

It is expected though that it would be a bit expensive treat. So ready your pockets to be deep enough. Save early and diligently. One more tip for guests and travelers, be mindful too of the weather conditions as although Singapore City usually is of fine 27-29 degrees warm, but part of tropical region as it is, even light rain pours could affect some rides and attractions.

Universal Studios is divided into 7 areas:

Hollywood
Madagascar
Far Far Away
The Lost World
Ancient Egypt
Sci-Fi City
New York

1. Hollywood

Hollywood is the main entrance of the theme park. In here, you'll be able to purchase merchandises of Universal Studios, souvenirs of famous characters like Hello Kitty, Minions and many more. You can also enjoy playing arcade on Hollywood China Arcade.

You'll have a chance to meet and greet, the Minions - just check the schedule time by downloading the Universal Studios app in Appstore or Playstore.

And get an American dish in Mel's Drive-In or energize up with a cup of coffee in Starbucks.

Catch the dazzling performers of Turntables show then finally, witness the Universal cast of characters in Hollywood Walk of Fame.

2. Madagascar

Feel the safari vibe of Africa in Madagascar and enjoy the rides such as King Julien's Beach Party Go Round and Madagascar, A Crate Adventure.

Catch the street entertainment of Madagascar Boogie!

Get goodies at Penguins Mercantile.

3. Far Far Away

Witness The Dance for the Magic Beans street entertainment and get on the 4D show experience in Shrek 4-D Adventure!

Meet the royal ogre family in Happily Ever After.

Cool down with the Fairy Godmother's Juice Bar, dine in Friar's and try their pizza, burgers and ice cream or try Goldilock's chicken.

Then go on a ride with Puss In Boots' Giant Journey, Magic Potion Spin and one of my favorite coasters ""Enchanted Airways"".

3. The Lost World

Let's go back to prehistoric age of Jurassic and get a stone grip in Amber Rock Climb or ride in Canopy Flyer. Young children will enjoy the Dino Soarin ride while tweens or young adults will be amazed with the raft ride of Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure.

Watch the Hatched! featuring Dr. Rodney or Look Out! Velociraptors have escaped in Jurassic Park! and the action thrilled of the Waterworld!
Try out Singapore's local dishes at Discovery Food Court or at Fossil Fuels.

Shop at The Dino-Store or at Jurassic Outfitters.

4. Ancient Egypt

Welcome to the Ancient world of Egypt and be thrilled with the extreme indoor roller coaster of ""Revenge of the Mummy"" or let the kids enjoy the desert ride of ""Treasure Hunters"".

Meet the Egyptian royalty during the golden age of Ancient Egypt.

Dine at Oasis Spice Cafe for lunch or get your souvenirs and collectibels like I did in Carter's Curiosities.

5. Sci-Fi City

Experience the extreme intergalactic war at Battlestar Galactica, Human vs. Cyclone mega roller coaster (which I skipped) or the ""Accelerator"" (similar to bump car which I skipped as well) and the one that I tried (finally), the ""Transformers the Ride, The Ultimate 3D Battle"". You have to hold your grip and stay focus on the screen so you won't get dizzy on this ride.

Take a photo with the Autobots like I did in Autobots, Roll Out!

After your experiencing extreme rides, you can dine in StarbBot Cafe or cool down with an icecream in Stardots.

Then men would certainly enjoy shopping at Transformers Supply Vault.

6. New York

Finally, explore my second favorite area which is the New York.

Go back to your childhood with the Sesame Street Spaghetti Space Chase then catch the Hollywood live show ""Lights, Camera, Action! Hosted by Steven Spielberg.

Meet and greet the Sesame Street characters or watch Marilyn Monroe's dazzling performance and take a chance to get a photo with her! Also, they're featuring Betty Boop. Catch the performance of  Rhythm Truck!

Shop for your kids at Big Bird's Emporium then dine at the KT's Grill for a late afternoon meal or try the sumputuous pizza at Louis NY Pizza Parlor or get early and start your day with the Sesame Street Character Breakfast.

Don't miss the Lake Hollywood Spectacular fireworks show which is only available every Saturday at 10pm and the Hollywood Dreams Light-up Parade which only takes place every Friday and Saturday at 7:30pm.

Tips:

1. Maximize the free map that you can grab on the main entrance.

2. Get the guide flyer to check the schedules of street performances, meet and greets and shows.

3. Download the app on your smartphone to plan your activities ahead of time.

4. To skip the long queue, you can get either of the following:

Universal Express for SGD $90 - it allows you to have an express pass to each attraction only once.

Meanwhile,

Universal Express Unlimited for SGD $120 allows you to have an unlimited pass to all attractions.

These passes are on top of your entrance ticket and it's optional.

5. Rent a locker where you can securely leave your stuff. Prices vary per area.

6. Put a sunscreen to protect your skin against harmful sun rays.

7. Buy a bottle of water to hydrate yourself time to time.

8. Bring an umbrella as it requires you to walk around the park under the heat of the sun.

9. Bring an extra t-shirt or top to change as you'll perspire a lot for sure!

10. Bring a powerbank and your smartphone with you. You don't want to miss capturing the highlights of your trip!

3,704506687,2019-08-29,OTHER,3,"The waiting time was usually inaccurate. A supposed 5 minute wait at the Madagascar crate ride turned out to be closer to 50 (we joked that it was missing the 0). Also, the ""common"" board published a different waiting time then the actual board at the attraction itself (happened to me for Puss in Boots - 5 mins on the common board and 60 on the attraction board. Correct timing is the 60.) The boards are annoying also because they keep changing to useless messages and then you have to wait forever for the waiting time to come back (if you felt confident enough to trust it anyway). It sucks that there is no reliable system where you can look at the waiting time and plan (at one point i was doing this running back and forth because I couldn't find out the correct waiting time for my target ride). I know queuing can't be avoided but at least the correct information should be made available somewhere so that we can at least decide what to do based on the wait time. Luckily the 25 minute wait advertised for Enchanted airways was reasonably close (Maybe I queued 35 mins in reality). 

It was okay I guess but looks better in pictures than in person. The walk to Waterworld was particularly ugly and uninspiring. Felt like a waste of space with nothing to see. It kind of felt like they got bored and ran out of ideas on how to make it pretty. Or maybe it's a work in progress. 

The halal option for food was ok: we ate at Marty's food court which I really enjoyed. Portions are large so we shared. Expensive but well. 

The mummy ride was closed: I wish there was system where we could be notified earlier (but considering that we would already have chosen our travel date much earlier, maybe it couldn't be helped, especially if the maintenance is adhoc? I certainly didn't remember seeing the maintenance notice when I was looking through the website doing research but that was months in advance of my stay). Maybe something at the point of time before we purchase the ticket? Thankfully I'm a bit of a scaredy cat so although I was disappointed I wasn't crushed. 

I managed to do 6 rides and 3 shows (with too much time wasted queuing for the deceptive boat ride) in about 7 hours. Which reminds me: when I was doing research earlier, I felt like I saw a scheduled closing time of 7pm, but this ended up to be 6pm on the actual day.

Even from the get go, the queue's at the rides were long and tedious when you are trying to contain young children, and no other entertainment was offered to perhaps entertain the queue's waiting in the sun, at times for up to an hour for a brief ride of a couple of minutes.
We found it hard to explain to the children about why some children just walked past the queue and got on the ride we had been waiting to get on for some time. This is the "" benefit' of the $110 express ticket on top of your entry price, which gets you to the front for the first ride, then you queue up with the main queue afterwards. However, the $140 unlimited ride was a real hard one to explain to them, as several children and adults just got off the ride, walked around us and got back on again.
Try explaining that to a restless pair of 6 year olds, who are bored to tears, and getting very hot out here in the sun after over an hour waiting.
Seriously not a good day, and some testy conversations with overworked staff did not help this situation at all. Cannot recollect this ever happening at any other park where staff have been helpful and eager to assist young children.

2. Buy your tickets and Express pass as early as you can as in when you make your holiday bookings for Singapore.  Don't wait until the day before.  The express pass has dynamic pricing and goes up

1) Get an express pass earlier. Purchase through Klook or any websites. Some attractions took us 120 minutes to queue!!

2) If you don’t have an express pass; opt for single rider. Save you lots of time!!

3) Bring a water bottle. Refill stations are everywhere even in the middle of a queue to any rides

4) Wear light & cooling cloths. Bring extra shirt. I was soaked wet after the Rapid Falls at the Lost World. But totally worth it

5) Use a sunblock and don’t forget your shades/caps etc

6) When you buy a soft drink or a set meal; you will get a plastic cup with a straw. Use this to refill your soft drinks or slush at any drinks counter at a cheaper rate. No point getting canned drinks at SGD$4.00/can when you can refill for SGD$3.00/drink

7) Don’t miss these:
- Waterworld Show
- Rapid Falls
- Puss in Boots Giant Journey
- Donkey Comedy Show
- there is one where they usher you into a studio and let you experience movie effects of a hurricane in a boat shelter at a New York harbour

8) Food is so-so & expensive. Food options here pale in comparison to Universal Studios Japan
- lots of food option available outside; get a stamp, go out & eat your meal then come back in

Приехали почти за час до открытия (метро+монорельс, от нашего отеля дорога заняла минут 20). Билеты купили быстро, стоимость 75 синг.дол. Есть билеты для прохода без очереди по 1 разу на каждый аттракцион (+50 дол) или безлимитно (198 дол.). Полный развод, там аттракционов всего около десятка. При расчете Mastercard выдают ваучер на 5 дол., который можно использовать в кафе парка. Но в 9-20 очереди на вход выстроились уже примерно по 100 метров. К открытию парка людей были толпы. Мы сразу побежали на «Трансформеров», но отстоять на вход пришлось 50 мин. Перед каждым аттракционом есть табло, показывающее время ожидания. Меньше часа не видела нигде. Плюс в наши планы вмешалась погода - как только на горизонте показывается туча, аттракционы под открытым небом закрываются. А дождь в Сингапуре идёт очень часто. Очереди в крытые аттракционы - более 2-х часов. Подведу итог - за целый день до закрытия мы посетили 3 аттракциона и 3 шоу, это при том, что парк работал на час дольше. В конце дня очереди меньше не стали, нигде меньше часа ожидания табло не показывали. Шоу «Водный мир» шло в этот день только один раз, аттракционы не работали часа 4. То, что успели посетить, нам понравилось, парк очень красочный, но толпы и жара с влажностью убили все впечатления. Территория оказалась очень небольшой, даже при перемещении от одного аттракциона до другого приходится протискиваться через толпы людей.По моему мнению, сюда стоит идти только с детьми сознательного возраста, чем занимали здесь родители маленьких детей  (на входе была масса родителей с колясками), для меня осталось полной загадкой. Взрослым, только если вы не суперфанат американских горок, на которые так и не удалось нам попасть, здесь делать особо нечего. Ну и если вы были в аналогичных парках, этот пункт смело можно пропускать. Возле испанского Порт Авентура этот парк и рядом не стоял, там количество аттракционов и их качество раза в 3 больше!

4,696076895,2019-08-06,OTHER,1,"Having been to Universal Studios Orlando, we thought it would be interesting to try the Singapore version of the theme park. However, with so few rides, we refused to shell out the 110 SGD they wanted for an Express Pass, as we thought it was a ripoff. The park is very small after all, and it doesn't have a lot of rides. So we chose to queue among the other commoners this time. Boy, what an ""experience"". 

Here's the thing: When you're in the regular queue, the estimated waiting times aren't working. It varies with the amount of Express Pass holders attending the ride, so if a ride displays a waiting time of just 20 minutes, it might end up being 40-50 minutes anyway, if lots of Express Pass holders go there. When you pay extra for the Express Pass, you're always prioritized over the regular crowd, so when you're in the regular queue, you can do nothing but stand still and with the Express Pass holders walk right onto the ride.

Luckily there's not really anything else to do besides queuing, as there aren't a lot of things going on around the park. Unlike most Disney parks, Universal Studios parks seem to lack smaller activities and areas around the park, where you can walk around and enjoy the scenery, or take a break from doing rides. 

The food is mediocre at best, and don't expect any smiles from the staff either. It's just an assembly line, and they can't wait to get rid of you. Only place we saw staff smiling, was in Starbucks, which is quite ironic.

Also, there's the pushing and shoving from all sides, which is common among people from certain countries. And when queuing for a ride, forget about having any personal space. You'll most likely have someone almost rubbing against you from behind, which is not the most pleasant thing, given the very hot and humid climate.

The rides are also disappointingly short, especially given the long waiting times.",By all means AVOID this daylight robbery!,2019-08-01,NONE,FootstepsDK,"Hillerod, Denmark",Hillerod,Denmark,-1
3,695783166,2019-08-05,OTHER,1,"The recent reviews are all true - so disappointing! If you have no choice but to visit this place, make sure you get an Express Pass (via Klook). It might be worth your time if you have this. We went on a Tuesday (not a public holiday) and the first couple of rides we took had us in the queue for around an hour or so! We had a 5 year old with us and with the temperature in SG, the queue was almost unbearable. We wanted to get an Express Pass after realizing our mistake of not getting one, but apparently, this will cost you an arm and leg if you buy in-house - 130 SGD EACH. We were 3 adults and 1 kid in our group. I couldn't bear swallowing down the cost so we persisted and still tried to line up and make do with our situation hoping that the other queues will be better. It did get better towards late afternoon/early evening before closing so there were shorter queues and our kid did enjoy several rides. We had an unfortunate experience though in one of the rides (Far Far Away: Puss In Boots’ Giant Journey). After we were in the queue for almost an hour and nearing the ride, a staff (local guy) came up to us and asked us how many we were - I answered ""we are 2+2"" while pointing to our group. He responded by raising his voice and saying ""what's 2+2?? I asked you how many you were!"" I was surprised by his tone and asked him what is wrong with him and then he just went off leaving us there – it seemed to me his shift was done. My son asked me what happened and I had to explain calmly that some people are not very smart and are rude. Anyway, this is just absolutely terrible customer service that you think you wouldn't have to deal with at this place. USS needs better queue management and better customer service training for their people. If you like theme parks and live in South East Asia, just go to Japan (Disney, Universal).

If you have ever been to the LA Universal there is a real difference between the two.  Singapore is more about the rides than the behind the scenes, understandably.  I’m glad this one has less 3D and 4D rides as they make me motion sick.

Souvenir shops were not as good as LA and the park didn’t have any Simpsons or Harry Potter attractions like LA.

7,691017444,2019-07-19,OTHER,2,"After reading some negative reviews, really didn’t want to go, but had promised the kids so had to go through with it. All the worst expectations were unfortunately fulfilled - the overcrowding was ridiculous. 
The cost to us as a family of 6 was $420, (children over 12 are considered adults, and there are no family tickets) and adding the recommended express passes to this was going to bring the total to $720, just not in the budget given the other activities we were doing over the week.
On the credit side, getting there is far easier than the zoo - catch the purple MRT line to HarbourFront, and you can from there walk to Sentosa for free over the boardwalk causeway - the best part of a km but aided by travelators. There is also the cable car (scenic but pricey) and the monorail.
Unfortunately, the crowds started immediately - even though we were there at 9:20, the line was already over 50m long. The pre booked tickets through Klook worked well however(scanning a phone barcode) so the line moved fairly quickly. Definitely do not buy tickets at the gate, as this will take much longer.
Once inside, got on the mummy ride very quickly, then the waited for 30mins to get on the Jurassic park rapids. After this though it was chaos - the crowds had swelled dramatically and even the lame kiddy rides like the Madagascar boat ride had waits of around 50 mins. Had to wait over 70 mins to get on the (admittedly very good) Battlestar Galactica Cylon roller coaster, while fighting evil thoughts toward the express pass holders who were waltzing past on the left the whole time.
After finally doing this ride, the crowds resembled LAX at rush hour, with lines even to buy overpriced food and drink. The kids were exhausted at this point so we left very disappointed. 
It would seem that express pass holders got onto the rides quite quickly, so if paying $130 pp is within your budget, more power to you. That said, many of the rides were quite meh compared to those at Disney or even Australia’s Gold Coast theme parks. The aforementioned Madagascar ride (an animatronic dark boat ride) has a very tight bar holding the rider in the seat, suggesting a Splash Mountain-esque payoff at the end - but there was absolutely no thrill whatsoever.
In summary, do this if you can justify the expense of an express pass, but expect insane crowds (no joy in the heat and humidity) and rides that are for the most part average by world standards.

Having spent about $80/head for tickets, we thought, although it’s a  fair amount of money, at least it’s unlimited rides. Also it wasn’t a weekend or school holidays, so thoughts were the crowd would be less.

Although this was true, we absolutely underestimated how long the queues are, and also the inequality between the ‘have’s’ and the ‘have nots!’. And by that I mean those with ‘Express Lane’ passes and those without. I’m not sure what other theme parks are like, but we (the have nots) lined up with the vast majority for 60min for a rollercoaster, while the Express Lane holders swept through their own queue to each ride, passing the rest of us. They do pay for the privilege, which I worked out to be roughly $210/person including entry, which is an outrageous price. 

They really should only have a single flat rate of entry, to ensure fairness, even if that is more than the $80 we paid. Ultimately without the rides, the place isn’t really worth visiting, and waiting 60min for the popular ones also makes it not worth visiting!

There are lots of complaints about long lines, but I think if you strategize your visit, you can avoid the worst of the queues. I've been to Universal Studios in Florida, which is far larger and, to be honest, better, but I still had a blast here. We came on a week day and arrived right as the park opened - always the best strategy. The park is so small that you can walk around the whole thing in about 10 minutes, but that just means you can more easily get to the rides you want to visit. 

Assuming you're not visiting with young kids, I would recommend doing rides like the Mummy and Lost World early in the day. See a show, have lunch (speaking of which, if you book on the Universal website, you can get a ticket with $5 meal voucher for cheaper than the cost of a single ticket), and then go for the less ""thrilling"" rides like the Shrek theatre, Spielberg experience, Puss in Boots ride, etc. Then, once 3-4 p.m. hits, there are pretty much no lines for the Transformers and BattleStar Galactica roller coasters!

Food is actually reasonably priced if you want to eat lunch here (and remember that meal voucher deal I mentioned!), and there are also lots of restaurants in the surrounding resort area outside the park where you can eat for probably even cheaper if you get a re-entry sticker.

Tickets are very pricy considering it’s not a massive park, but we had a great day out. 

We were there for opening, and literally went on every ride we walked past to beat the queues. However by the time we got half way around we had to succumb to waiting in lines. We waited over an hour for the River Rapids ride which was lots of fun, but that was the last ride I was prepared to wait like that for. Universal studios is very popular so it would likely be like this every day. The skip the queues Pass was expensive and quite frankly, there was still a wait to go on rides. We found the best thing to do was to separate and my husband went on rides as a single rider. You can beat an hour long queue using this trick, getting on the ride within 10 minutes in some cases. 

Many rides are for younger riders, but that was fine for us. Food wasn’t over the top expensive, but again lots of people means lots of waiting.","A good day out, but big queues",2019-07-01,FAMILY,topdeck73,"Melbourne, Australia",Melbourne,Australia,-1

We went on a Thursday, reached around 11am. To be honest, the first impression was that it is really small. I have been to Disneyland Paris and Universal was nothing compared to that.
The park has 7 themed zones but each has only 2 rides at max. The only zone with more than 4 rides was the Jurassic park. The park has 2 roller coasters in Sci-fi (Humans and Cyclone), 1 in Ancient Egypt and rest are kiddie rides mostly. Transformers in the Sci-fi Zone is a must do.
Tickets on the official website priced around INR 4200 per person. But we booked on Klook for INR 3500. Klook has amazing offers for most activities so do check prices here before booking anything. 
June being school holidays in Singapore it was still pretty crowded but if you visit on a weekday in any other month, it should be a breeze. 
The Express Pass was a total waste of 40$, as the park has limited rides to justify that cost, over and above the entry ticket cost. A good hack is to try Singles line. The Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure, had a 100 min waiting time, but all 4 of us were in the ride within next 10 mins through the Singles Lane.

Honestly this was one of the worst paid for 'experiences' we've ever had anywhere in the world. 1.5hrs of queuing for a ride which said it was a 45 min wait at the start. The ride took 7.5 mins. Another one was a 45min wait for a 35 sec ride. Hot, stinky, crowded queues.

Two of the family rides weren't even working when the park opened because of what the staff said were technical problems.

The kicker is when you do decide to pay the extra 70SGD pp for an 'Express' ticket to jump the queue, they then use surge pricing and say it will cost 140SGD pp (no discount for kids). Even those with Express tickets had to wait 45mins to ride the Jurassic Park Rapids when the average ticket holder had to wait 2hrs.

In the midst of this self-punishment I tried to get a beer. Waited in line for 5 mins to get to the front only to be told the 11SGD beer had sold out. I guess there were other desperate adults who'd got there quicker.

As well as that when the kids wanted photos with the characters they were told no, only photos taken by professional photographers.

avoid Friday - Monday if you can , that’s when it’s busiest .
Be there when gates open at 10 am and go directly to the busiest rides most popular rides , don’t dawdle ( transformers , mummy , Jurassic park for older kids) by 11am the park is extremely busy and starting to peak .
Take a water bottle , there are watercoolers in some wait line areas and scattered around park and taps in restrooms , otherwise drinks are expensive .
If you are not sure about buying express passes and cost , wait until you get there to buy them , see what the crowds are like , the day we went we didn’t need them but we followed our own tips ! 
You can get a pass out , try to avoid riding amusements in peak time 11 am - 1630 hrs , do the shows , go to lunch outside the park , or back to hotel if close . By 1700 the lines will have subsided and waiting will be much more reasonable .
Make sure you get a show timetable on admission and plan what you are watching and which characters you want to meet and greet .
Travel as lightly as you can , don’t take a huge bag it’s just cumbersome to offload fir rides etc.
Check out options of riding as a single if lines are long often this can make the process quicker .
You may get wet on the Jurassic jungle ride , factor this into your day

was looking forward to this the most in Singapore, and made sure we rested up well to walk for a long time today around the park. easy to get to in a grab with little shops around to look in before going into the park. tickets were usual price you would expect to pay, 70-80$. we upgraded to express pass (1 ride per attraction) for 50$ or you can do 80$ for unlimited shots at the rides. agree with a previous comment - even though you're in the express line, people push past you straight to the front saying 'express, express' even though we're all in the same, express line. also strangely, we were in express line with lots of other people, had to get the ticket scanned in to get in the line yet the young lady at the Jurassic world ride picked us out of the line and asked to see our tickets? no one else, just us, strange..
staff hardly smile and aren't very helpful at all, just sign your card and that's it no commentary or telling you where to go. 
transformers is totally unnecessarily jolty, I was 1 second from puking in the ride just from the throwing around. 
shrek land was great and fun. sesame street a bit lame. other zones were very short lived, walk along and you're in the next zone already. return of the mummy was great, not really for kids. 
partner liked the rollercoasters but really only a couple that weren't for kids. perhaps some more adult ones would be good. 
Louis's pizza place was 11$ for one slice of pizza. pretty nuts.

Well it's actually a bit of hit and miss. You will find inside 4 ok thrill rides. The 2  battle star roller coasters, bumblebee transformers ride and and the Return of the Mummy ride. All the other maybe 5 rides are for kids and not very exciting.
The benefits of the unlimited Express  pass is you won't have to wait in long ques (although some rides we still waited 20 min as alot of people get the express pass and are very ""entitled"" about it, and will push and yell at you in broken english how they have express pass). But believe me, you won't want to get unlimited as the rides are not do thrilling you want to go more than once. 
If you get the regular 70 dollar ticket, expect to wait at least 40 min per ride and up to 2 hours.

The park is structured in a circle so that you can start in one direction and see the entire park in one lap. The rides and experiences are limited but easier to explore the whole park in less than a day without exhausting yourself. Only a couple of roller coasters (2 outdoors and 1 indoor) but the park has a good mix of thrill rides and family rides and theatre shows / experiences.

There's a limited amount of rides and the lines to popular (best) ones are ridiculous. Even the Express Pass lines were over 30+ minutes at times. And without it almost two hours. The lines are not controlled very well either and e.g. the single riders lines were heavily occupied by people trying to get into rides together with family members (and the staff allowed this). Not as organized as in US versions.

If you have never been to a similar park and are able to visit outside the holiday season this might be a good idea. But if you expect something similar than in US versions you might be disappointed.

1. Battlestar Galactica: Cylon 
2. Revenge of the Mummy
3. Transformers the ride

- Battlestar Galactica: Human was average compared to Cylon. 
- Lights, Camera, Action was enjoyable.  
- Sesame Street spaghetti space chase was really boring for a 12 year old- it’s for much younger children. 
- Waterworld show was entertaining. The show timings on Monday when we were there was 1 pm, 4:15 pm and 7 pm. It’s worth watching. It’s approx a 30 minutes show.
- Canopy flyer was good fun.
- Jurassic Park rapids adventure- my son enjoyed this a lot - you will get wet in this ride. You can buy a poncho for $2 before you get on the ride. Even with the poncho on, your shoes are likely to get wet.
- Madagascar: A crate adventure was avoidable- again a ride for much younger kids.
- Puss In boots giant journey - it’s a good thrilling ride which you can take with the family. Enjoyable.

We took the express unlimited pass - it is very expensive but it’s worth the money spent as 1 hour waiting’s are reduced to 5 minutes. This helped us do our favorite rides (all the 3 key roller coasters) thrice each! I strongly recommend buying this pass.
Lots of snacking options throughout the park. Also lots of places to fill your water bottle- carry an empty bottle with you. 
Lunch options are good. For vegetarians, and wanting Indian food, head out to the Oasis of Spice in the Ancient Egypt area. Good food! Also you can get a margarita pizza and a vegetarian pasta in Loui’s pizzeria in New York area.

The best rides were the roller coaster ride in the lost world section , transformer 4d ride cum show in the sci- fi section , 4d movie in the far far away section ,river rafting in the lost world section  rest of the rides were so- so and not worth the waiting time ,but the those mentioned above were awesome and could be done more then once , but apart from ride the set up was magnificent and very imposing , the very idea of creating something so grand deserves great appreciation , since it was school holidays , the closing time was extended to 10:00 pm , which made it possible for us to explore the entire park otherwise it would have been impossible with the wait time , did I mention the fire cracker show in the end which with icing on the cake , for my Indian friend , there is a food joint by the name of Oasis which serves excellent , veg and non veg food which came in very handy. 
An important observation was that after 5:30 pm the waiting time reduced to 10-15 min and it was during this time that we were able to enjoy majority of the rides .

1. Buy Universal Express ticket as well.

This ticket does not cover all rides though like canopy flyer, Battlestar galactic (roller coaster), treasure hunt (waste of your time).
2. Food there is expensive however if have no choice then eating there cause you can't exist to come back. So prepare to spent
3. Try to go on Friday and Saturday as the opening time is from 10am -10pm so you have more time. Believe me, with express pass I was only manage to complete at 9pm all the rides.

It is divided into zones like Egypt, Shrek world, Sci-fi city etc. Four to five rides in each of the six zones catering to all age groups. It opens at 10 in the morning and it helps be there as the gates open especially on a crowded day like we encountered. We were hoping to get by with just our park tickets but within half hour realized that without Express pass we won't be able to cover even half of it.

Express pass is sold in nearly all stores inside the park, we bought ours for a King's ransom at the Hollywood street. The pass price fluctuates as the crowd levels rise and fall, It's probably best to buy it beforehand on their website where we saw it listed the cheapest. Armed with pass we were able to bypass wait times that sometimes extended beyond 90 minutes. 

Some of the more memorable rides were Puss'n'boots roller coaster, Cyclone and Transformers 3D ride. The live action show called Waterworld was quite a crowd puller, even the large arena was packed to capacity. They cancelled their evening show midway with worsening weather but we returned for the evening one since it had piqued our curiosity. 

We had our lunch at a self serve pizzeria called Loui's. Most cuisines were covered in the various restaurants located around the park, there was even an Indian food court near the Mummy returns ride. The slushies and drinks were expensive for the initial buy with them selling the park branded sippers but the refills were cheaper later. 

I'd recommend taking the boardwalk from Vivocity mall down to Universal like we did. It's free and you would enjoy walking over a sea bridge, especially if the weather is pleasant.

he madagascar water ride is probaly only good to ride on if you have young kids that enjoy it otherwise it will be abit boring for you unless you were about 6 years old.

The jurrasic park rides are great rides.the canopy flyer is good but it goes for about 2p seconds so you will literally get all pumped up on it then before you know it yoi will be exiting the ride.if it was longer it would be good,
The water raft in jurrasic world is another good ride.but if you dont mind getting drenched by water i suggest having a poncho on the ride and enjoy the dinosaur ride and visual effects around you,tho if your shoes do get wet i can bet they proably will there is a drying machine just outside the exit and souviner shop where i think it was $2SGD to get it working

Revenge of the mummy was probaly my faviroute ride there as the whole scenery was quite extrodinary with the eygptian statues etc for the ride cause i like that stuff but the ride was just fun with alot turns and bumps so its worth checking out

Battlestar galactia is also my 2nd pick as it was your best rollercoaster there which was fast and exciting.if you have any objects in your pocket tho coins,wallet,passport or phone its best to leave them behind in the locker nearby or with whomever as you will be checked with metal detector as precaution before you enter just for safety.

Transformers ride i did not go on tho the line up was pretty long as i waited in express for 20 minutes then just got over it and left as a monsoon just comeover

Lockers are around the park and are free for the first 45minutes then after that you will have to pay.

1,678671328,2019-06-03,MOBILE,1,"USS was once a gem but it is starting to show its age. Despite operating in tropical Singapore for so long it has done little to improve visitor’s experiences. It is still too humid in the heat and just lack proper sheltered area or alternative attractions when it rains.

USS may have added a few new attractions and expand the park over the years but at the same time seem to have forgotten to upkeep the rest of the older rides and shows. 

There are so many issues observed in a single visit. If a queue to a ride or show is open, one would expect it to be operating fully but during our visit the Transformer ride has TV monitors at the queue that were faulty and wet floor at the queue area (and it was indoors and not even raining outside). This was not the only ride fault. At the Shrek 4D show, it was worst as none of the effects were in operation (might as well call it Shrek 3D) during the last slot timing. Over at the King Julien’s Go-Round, the ride’s up and down mechanism seems jerky (no wonder they advise safety belts). Even the shows have their share of ‘technical’ difficulties, the Elmo show stopped abruptly midway and the visitors were told to leave the theater. Paint works around the park have peeled from either from wear and tear or just poor maintenance. 

The staff at the park also seems to lack proper training as announcements are inaudible, they do not manage the queue or able to give clear directions to various attractions. Most seems to lack the motivation to serve and do not exhibit any friendly welcoming vibes. 

All these issue just sums up to a poorly manage theme park. It is a total waste of time and money to visit the place at its current state.

Pros...
Great selection of big and small kid rides
Really great quality food
Friendly helpful staff
Really easy to get around
Virtually no waiting for rides 
Just a great place to take kids

Cons....
Not as big as other Universal studios theme parks but still heaps of fun.

Well worth the $$$$ 
Get to the gate 20 min before opening hit the rides early and shop in air conditioning in the afternoon. 

Just one more thing I'd like to mention that isn't the parks fault but does happen on every Que for every ride is ..... the Indians! I've never been to India but I'm guessing cutting in line is acceptable there. They send someone to get in line and then when the rest of their group show up the politely shuffle to the front one at a time until there is 8 or 9 in front of you.
Or when you are lined up for a ride that is clearly designed for kids under 5 years old and 40 or more adult Indian people with express passes line up and have everyone else's small children waiting in the sun for grandma ,grandpa ,all the uncle's and aunts, mum and dad to have a ride with their one member of their group under 5yrs old.
Like I said this is not the parks fault but if you have a short fuse with line jumpers and grown ups riding kids stuff while your kid is roasting in the sun because a 55 year old man rides the merry go round , you will need to know this is going to happen",Small but awesome,2019-05-01,FAMILY,chriso308,"Greater Newcastle, Australia",Greater Newcastle,Australia,1

All the larger rides are to the right after you walk down the main street so if that’s what you’re there for walk anti clockwise and do them first.  We arrived about 9:30am ready for the gates to open and went straight to the larger roller coaster rides.  We had multiple turns on Human, Cylon and Revenge of the Mummy with hardly any wait in the first hour.  After this though the queue time extended out to 90 mins.  It paid to be flexible though as at times we wandered past again the wait time was only 20mins so would line up for another turn. The Water World show was awesome and if you sit near the front be prepared to get wet. Meals start at around SGD 15 for a burger/drink combo and go up in price from there.  The Transformers ride was great fun, my 11 year old does not like roller coasters and he had multiple turns on Transformers.

There seemed to be a section still under construction, it looks like a water park. A huge downside of this park is the queues are very misleading. The times on the boards are virtually always wrong. They also have a very devious way of turning the queues into different rooms or chambers hidden from each other, so you cant really see how far away you are from the ride.

The other ride, Transformers, we had to wait for half an hour in the queue to get into the ride. This was so disappointing. We lost our valuable one hour because of these issues.

1,674052568,2019-05-14,OTHER,4,"Like other theme parks, USS is one of the interesting place to visit for thrill seekers. They have the Transformers 4D rides which is a family favourite- so take note the que could get really really longgggg. My favourite indoor ride is The Mummy and it’s Good although it’s in the dark hehe. The cyclone rides were amazing (repeated 3 times) but didn’t get to experience the human rides (long que). Apparently people choose human rides because it’s less thrilling than the cyclone rides so that’s why the lines were shorter  if you wanna get wet (like me), you could get on one of rides in Jurassic World but no worries there’s a drying pod for SGD5 only.

We went there on Sunday so the crowd was OK, so some rides has shorter que. Please check the weather before visiting as it could get tooo sunny or u don’t wanna get soaked in the rain. When we went there the weather was like 39 dgrees so we were in our sweats all the time 

We loved the cafe located in front of the show theatre (forgot the name) coz it’s halal and there’s a cute Elmo burger. Other cafes are ok as well but we only tried 2 of them.

Made the most of all the shows and planned day around them, not rides. Water world show was great and stunt actors even stayed after show to have photos taken. Kids will love IT.

2,673893851,2019-05-14,MOBILE,3,"We visited during the Easter holidays. Having previously visited other Universal parks, we were mindful of the fact that this park would be a little more limited in size and have fewer of the large rides. The park is similar in size or scale to Euro Disney with perhaps 3/4 larger rides for the teenagers.

We bought our tickets as part of a combined ticket with the Sentosa Cable Car, which was a reasonable deal. A short taxi from the hotel to Mount Faber meant we started the day with a bit of an adventure for the kids. (You can buy the combined ticket at the Mount Faber cable car station.) Having tickets in advance meant queuing for entry to the park itself was not too bad, although signage from the cable car stop on Sentosa to the Universal park could be better. (Once you disembark on Sentosa, you actually need to walk about 100 yards and change onto an additional cable car to take you to the park entrance.)   

Getting there early meant that the queue times for the main rides was about 15-20 minutes. It’s worth mentioning that the ride staff are very hot on making sure you don’t take anything on the rides with you e.g. phones and loose change, making sure pockets are empty and going to the extent of using a security wand to check every rider to make sure. If they find anything, they send you back to the lockers. Each large ride has it’s own lockers which are free for an initial period, but cost thereafter. We also rented a larger locker for our backpack, which we had to pay for. 

Unfortunately on the day we visited the weather was patchy with occasional rainstorms. If there is any threat of thunder/lightning then the larger rides are temporarily stopped. Clearly this is done from a safety perspective to avoid lightening strikes.  However the rides don’t handle this particularly well. We waited approximately 50 minutes for the Battlestar Galactica Cylon ride. Having got to within 5 people of boarding the ride, the ride was suspended due to the incoming thunder storm. No indication is given on how long the delay will be. (Clearly the park has some form of weather monitoring to be able to suspend the ride in advance, so surely some form of indication of the length of the potential suspension is possible, or alternatively, offer a temporary fast pass option to those who have queued.) 

While the weather was bad we watched the WaterWorld show, which is a water based stunt show. This was very well done. The marking of the seats as to whether you  will get wet or not is worth noting. The wet seats get an absolute soaking both before and during the show.

It was a fun day despite the weather. It’s easily possible to do the bulk of the larger rides in half a day, meaning you can visit some of the other attractions on Sentosa.",Check the weather forecast before you go.,2019-04-01,FAMILY,holl3411,"Exmouth, United Kingdom",Exmouth,United Kingdom,-1

Alight at the last stop — Harbourfront Station. 2.Walk into the VivoCity Mall and climb to Level 3 of the Mall, its near in KFC Proceed to Lobby L.

Board the monorail train. Alight at Waterfront Station. 4.Follow the signs and you’ll find yourself staring at the Universal Studios rotating globe soon after. 5.You can also take the Sentosa Boardwalk to get to the island.

My favourites were the transformers, the mummy, camera action show and the rollercoaster (the one your legs are hanging).
Food is ridiculously expensive, I've been to many amusement parks, I always expect it to be, but this one is so over.
You can cross the bridge to Sentosa by walking for free and still take the train back for free. Transport around the island is free as well.

Due to bad weather, outside attractions stayed closed for around 2h, really bad, made everything else much busier.

But, what really ruins the park, is the express pass. You can pay ~$40 for skipping the line once for every attraction or ~$70 for unlimited.

Problem is, sometimes it gets so crowded, the queue is so long, that it is bad for everyone.

I was at the queue for a rollercoaster, it was saying 30min waiting, and then people with express pass started to come (there's a different queue for them), and they were coming quicker then the rollercoaster could take, so we started to have 2 queues, one for regular other for express, and the worst, only their queue was moving! There was times were 15minutes would pass and my queue wouldn't move, only theirs!

I ended up staying for almost 2h in the line, for a 1:30min ride, totally crap.

And even for those who paid express pass, it's not a big deal. Have you magined if everyone has it? You are not skipping anymore, and the park is making much more money..

Another good move would be to put signs along the queue path indicating how long is the waiting time from that point. Most of the time, the queue is curvy and you can't see the end of it, so you have no idea of how far you really are.

My tip for you: unless you're a teenager with lots of energy to spend standing in a queue, don't go in the morning and don't give them more money for a express pass.
Go in the afternoon, around 4pm, it's not that warm anymore, on weekend it closes at 10pm, so you still have 6h left, and all the rides have almost no queues.",Express Pass ruins it,2019-05-01,COUPLES,LucasDize,"Adelaide, Australia",Adelaide,Australia,-1

then walk to Jurasic, bring extra clothes since Jurasic Park Rapids Adventures will make you soaking wet for sure, or Bring Poncho if you can. 

Enjoy as much as you can, if you're still up for a thrill, Look for the wall climbing near within the Jurasic park. 

If you have time, check for the itinerary of street entertainment and Waterworld show.
you can also go Outside to eat for lunch, its way cheaper,

When we pay good money at the gate, we expect all rides to function. They conveniently stopped the Jurassic World Rapids Ride and almost stopped Revenge of the Mummy ride but I think the anger of the crowds made them restart the spectacularly scary Ancient Egyptian treat.

Some tips:

1. The food there is expensive and of very high quality. Indian Food being the best. A family of 4 can order 1 Mutton Biriyani, they will add lots of veggies with it, so add 4-5 parathas with that and share.
2. They did not check us for water bottles, so try your luck.
3. We went on a Sunday, so wait times were like 70-80 minutes for main rides. I bought the express ticket. Worth the extra money as our wait times were 2 minutes and we could enjoy hours of the Hollywood Ambience after we completed our rides.

However, going to our second ride they didn’t let us get on, there were some thunders and they were afraid a thunderstorm was coming and didn’t know when the rides would be back on again. We decided to ask for a refund for the very expensive ($120) express pass we just paid but apparently they don’t offer a refund in any case. We were really annoyed as we just purchased that few minutes ago and the people who sold it to us should have mentioned the weather. Also while we were waiting to request the refund the employee sold the same tickets to a family and didn’t say a word. 
We took the matter to the customer service and after a long conversation they were sincerely apologetic and said that the employees should have told us in advance. They offered us coupons and stickers to our little one and we tried to get the most out of it, and visit all the indoors ride and shows.

From around lunch time even the kids rides had a wait of close to an hour. Like may other people have said, it's extremely hot in Singapore so waiting around in the heat for close to an hour for a ride that only goes for a minute or 2 is ridiculous, especially with kids. 
The park is small in size, so it doesn't take long to get around. Attendants at the rides had no personality and moved so slow getting people on and off rides. If it was managed better I'm sure the wait times would have been halved. Most of them seemed to be so unhappy with their jobs, no smiles or happy faces.
We would have been able to get on more rides with the fast track tickets, however the cost on this day was the same price as a ticket $70SGD pp which was more than we wanted tp spend, so we just raced around as soon as we got into the park to get as much doon as fast as we could.
We watched the Sesame Street show, I would recommend for 0-5 years, WaterWorld Show was good, but very very very hot sitting around. We also watched Shrek 4D which was good even though our chair broke 1/2 way through!
We left the park at lunch time and got a pass out as there were many well priced restaurants (including McDonalds) a whort walk away.

Before bringing my Son I thought to visit first and inquire and experience enough to make my son's visit very comfortable and productive. Since I don't watch much of the kids serials so I had not much idea for this whole concept. A complete day was spent over there. Since we visited on Saturday so we had option to stay until 10 PM night. The first thing is there are some online options available to buy tickets so explore that and you may get 10% discount. If you want to cover all rides. Either you start as early as 10 AM in the morning or else you buy express pass. For 1-2 minutes ride you may have to wait for an hour or so. The Roller Coaster was amazing. I had tried the Cyclone one. There is another roller coaster related to transformer. That can also be experienced. We watched some animated movies which was amazing and those were must watch. It is good to visit this place the day when it is not very hot as you have to walk in open area. You  should spend time in the evening also to see the effect of lights. Some of my conclusions about Singapore Universal studios are as below.

1. The Size of this Studio is relatively smaller than US.
2. Number of rides are less.
3. The tickets are relatively cheaper.
4. The age of the kid should be more than 6 to enjoy this place.
5. If you are having great flair for Roller Coaster then you should visit this place. If not you can avoid this place.

While there is no complaint on actual rides or the shows... i felt the owners are in the business of money minting rather than providing entertainment  :(  Let me share my experience:

we reached the universal studios at 9:30AM, the gates open at 10AM, each line has already a que of 30 - 40 people standing and waiting. 

@10AM they opened the doors, we first entered madagaskar, first two of my rides are done with 10 mins waiting. 
@11AM we entered the jurassic park, for the boat ride we entered the queue, it took 1 hour 10 mins for us to get in to a ride of 3 minutes , 
By this we already tired of standing a long queue and its 12:30 by the time we finish this. 
Later we went to Egyptian theme (Revenge of the mummy), the board said it has a wait time of 120 Mins :( At this time we checked few other places, every where the minimum standing time in queue is more than 80 Minutes :( Horrible 

Later we went to lights camera action, we stand in queue for 15 mins, while the show is good... 

The major problem for the entire US is long wait times.even after one spending $75 you have to wait for 1 - 2 hours for your favorite ride, in reality you won't be covering more than 4 - 5 rides on a peak day and is total waste of money and time. 

Just to add pain to the wound, they have an express line which they charge another $70 or so where you get direct access to the rides.. ( nice way to mint more money .. by making every one stand for hours and than collect extra amounts for faster access)

By the way, i rate very high about quality of shows and rides (you enjoy them)

We went during a week day expecting less crowd, but were surprised with the amount of people and decided to purchase the Express tickets (best decision). This saved us hours of queuing time and allowed us to visit all the attractions. 

The highlight of the park is the HUMAN Vs CYLON. 

CYLON is the most thrilling of the rides and along with my son, we had the most fun in this ride. Make sure that you wait for an extra turn to take the front row seats as this provides the maximum thrill especially when it accelerates fast and dives down. This ride involves sudden acceleration, fast dives and 5 times in the ride it goes upside down. Make sure that the stomach is empty before this ride

HUMAN on the other hand is a bit subdued with no 360 degree rotation. It is much doable for those afraid of the roller coaster rides.

The other rides worth doing (In the order of preference)
- Transformers the ride
- Mummy
- Lost world Rapids adventure (You will be soaked)
- Shrek 3D 
- Puss in the Boots
- Lights camera Action

The only show that is worth seeing (Must do) is the water world show next to the Jurassic world. Show timing is at 4:30pm. Make sure to arrive at 4:10pm to get the best seats.

Overall a fun filled day and based on the crowds, it is worth buying the express pass. Food is expensive inside and Louis pizza is recommended.

As soon as you enter,no matter how tempted you are to click pictures,but start with the rides first,as the queues (per ride) may get bigger,if u get late for the rides.

The rides we did as per the different zones were -
1) Sci fi zone - Transformers 3D ride (the perfect start to an adventurous day)
2) Sci fi zone - Battlestar Galactica Human (Cyclon is one notch up) n we totally enjoyed the scare,the shouts n the adrenaline rush.
3) Mummy zone - Revenge of the mummy (Dark n scary)
4) Jurassic Park - Rapid Adventure
5) Water world show (if you are looking at a play with lots of Bollywood action)

7)Far far away - Shrek 4D (our daughter enjoyed it but it was an ok experience,can be missed if you try the puss in boots ride)

VIP experience is a 5 hours guided tour of USS covering almost all the rides and zones along with a guide and the best part is we get priority entry everywhere. We are literally treated as VIPs. 

As per the instructions shared during our booking, we reach USS 15-20 mins before the tour started. In our case the tour was scheduled to start at 10:00 AM. We were introduced to our guide Jethro and he was an amazing person. He explained to us the various zones in the park, asked our preferences and planned the entire tour in such a way that we have the best experience without missing any of the rides or shows. 

As mentioned earlier, we got priority entry to almost all the rides and shows, watched the Waterworld stunt show from an exclusive airconditioned viewing room, front row seats to all rides and shows, food coupons, special tags, badges, etc.

These proved invaluable and ensured that we waited no more than 20 minutes in a queue for the rides so I recommend the investment if you are wanting to spend the day on the rides.  Huge down pour an hour before the gates opened which must never deterred people from coming as the place didn't seem too busy or crowded.  There are free lockers for between 45 or 105 minutes (free period depends on the length of the queues at the relevant rides) otherwise it is up to $S20 for the day.  Lucky enough to go on about 30 rides as the express pass lines were not more than 20 minutes, most rides we were able to get on straight away.  Plenty of food options available however most were closed due to the smaller crowds and I assume the weather but still plenty of choice.  Otherwise, get a pass out and go the the food options outside the park.  Fireworks were ok without being spectacular but worth waiting for and a good way to close out the day.

If you have bags put them in an all day locker at the lockers next to River Rapids ride in Jurassic area; don't fall for the timed lockers next to the rollercoasters because you'll likely overrun your tine and pay extra - seriously just get an all day locker or take nothing with you.

Most of the rides have been around for a few years so it was a bit of a repeat from our trip 4 years ago, but the Rollercoasters were new and a lot of fun.

We went with two adults and two kids (15 and 12).  The best rides were, in order, the Ceylon Rollercoaster, transformers ride, hi an rollercoaster and the Mummy Rollercoaster.

Pretty good range of food.  Prices are OK - what you would expect at any theme park.

My tip is to avoid long lines for the biggest rides by waiting until around 4pm.  You will wait around 10-15 minutes and be able to have multiple rides in a short period.  Just monitor the times from around 3pm.",Best Roller Coaster,2019-04-01,FAMILY,Mathew H,"Hobart, Australia",Hobart,Australia,1

We didn't BUT we got there nice and early and were prepared. We got to Vivo City at 8:40am and waited until 9am for the Sentosa counters to open.  We bought our tickets there so when we got over we could go straight in.  We got there first thing and waited by the gates.  We were first in line when it opened at 10am. They do a little intro and they had a thing where the most enthusiastic patron won express passes. My son was lucky enough to win,  so he got 5 fast passes for any ride for the day.  1 time use.
So when we got in we ran straight to the Transformers ride and got straight on. 
We then managed to go on most rides and got you the Waterworld Show for 12:30.
A must see show!
Then we had lunch at Mels Diner where they had awesome Elmo Burgers, that actually tasted amazing,  and Cookie Monster shakes!
Then we had the longest wait for any ride,  1hr 30mins for the Human roller coaster.  We had gone to go earlier but it was closed for technical issues.  So we lined up but right as we got to the top they closed it again.  We took the gamble to wait and we waited a further 20mins at the top to get on.  A little annoying was once the ride was up and going again they had reopened the line downstairs so all these fast pass people got straight on and the people who had loyally waited out the technical issues waited even longer.

- the mummy (went on 3x!)
- Sci Fi accelerator 
- the Human roller-coaster

Good shows for adults:
- lights camera action

Tips:
- buy the express pass ($30 for one use per attraction) 
- your shoes (and socks) will get wet on the Jurassic Park Rapids ride
- try to eat before, a slice of pizza is $11 and a small bottle of water is $4
- they wouldn't let us bring in a bottle of water (unless you can hide it)
- there are refill taps and drinking fountains everywhere

My two cents on the Express pass:
I was originally against the express pass, seemed like a huge waste of money but after considering we were able to on ride within 0-20 mins instead of waiting 40-60 mins, it was well worth it. 
I went on a Monday and the average wait time for the popular rides I recommended was 60 mins, due to weather the roller-coaster wait time was 120 mins.
In my opinion the unlimited express $70 isn't really needed, but the $30 limited pas is great value.

You can go into Universal Studios and check out the estimated wait times as you can buy the express pass at any time once you're inside anyway.",Better than I expected for a group of adults: recommend the $30 express pass,2019-04-01,FRIENDS,Amy C,"Melbourne, Australia",Melbourne,Australia,1

It’s pretty small and lacks most of the contemporary attractions. There’s no Harry Potter or adult themed rides beyond The Mummy (which is great).  It is clean and well maintianed though.

The overall atmosphere is not one of joy or adventure - just random disorganised chaos. I think they could benefit from more staff on the ride entry areas and marshalling people generally. It’s common in Asia for there to very large organised groups moving around together and this is not helpful in a theme park setting.

It’s got some unique rides (the Jurrasic Park raft elevator and drop concept is cool) but the overall issue here is severe lack of crowd control and the whole queue management issue.

Be patient. Drinks lots of water and be prepared to wait. Even with a express pass.

Speaking of which - the express pass needs to be printed out so the ride staff can literally tick off (with an actual pen) which rides you’ve been on. It’s 2019. But go figure.

The staff are permanently having to repeat ‘use the lockers’ and ‘no bags’ to EVERY rider. There are no clear signs. The locker areas are small and chaotic. Be prepared to leave you stuff, no matter how small - so do all these rides in one maybe?

First impression, the decorations are in line with the sesame street 50 birthday celebration. 

Hearing from friends that the transformer 3d ride is very popular, we decided to go for it first, we were lucky that the queue took us around 15mins, which is still acceptable, as we were in time for our next planned show. 

Enjoyed the Elmo TV show, saw our favorite characters, interesting presentation too.

After the shrek 4d, our young child seems pretty overwhelmed, refusing to go for any other rides the whole day, not even the the merry go round at the Madagascar.

Luckily, there are the sesame street birthday blowout and the Oscar trash beats to entertain us. We also get to sit and rest in the air_con emporium food court at new york, hiding from the heat several times without being thrown out.

Food: we had our lunch at the Mel's, a very expensive meal, $16 for a Elmo burger with fries and $16 a bacon beef burger with fries, $12 for a drink, in total spent $44 for just a simple meal. It was a hot day, with not much appetite, the 2 sets was enough for 2 adults and a child to share. Probably the staff would like to remind guests that the eyes and the nose on elmo is just printed paper and not edible. Our child took a bite on it, happily thinking it was chocolate.

Retail: The selection of souvenirs and toys are wide, prices are quite reasonable for some, especially the toys.

The only ride that was slightly disappointing was the Puss in Boots coaster, it stops and starts too much and doesn't really succeed as either a thrill ride or a story ride as it tries to do both.

Cheaper to buy online I guess, but you can still get one in vivo city 3rd floor, or at the universal studios entrance. Try to visit some travel advisors located all around the city, they might give good advice: for example, they gave me the brochure with which we could save 10% from Studio's ticket. 
We were one of the first to arrive at the studio's entrance. A line gathered about 15 minutes prior to opening.Host at the entrance also gave one RED TICKET (I think it offers you to pass all lines and/or limitless rides) for the person who was the loudest.

Though I did find the place interesting and memorable, having been to Hong Kong Disneyland, I prefer the latter more. I expected more, really. 

With all honesty, I think the only difference among the rides there is the theme. I don't think those rides are that special since those were mostly rollercoasters, nothing more. I craved for a variety of rides that were full of originality and creativity.

Personally, I believe the scorching temperature and humid weather may have influenced my feedback. I don't think December was the perfect time to be there since I was overwhelmed with the crowd.

This is where a taxi or Singapore’s version of Uber called Grab (an excellent service)will drop you off.
When we arrived the queues to get in were massive luckily we had purchased tickets online so that was one less queue to be in . 
Very quickly we figured out that people will queue if there is a queue . The secret is to walk the path less trodden . At the main gates there are multiple entry points people just seem to gravitate to the centre walk to the sides and you can walk straight in. 
There is a fast pass available and we were there on a very busy day but the secret to not needing one is to not go to the first ride  walk on to the third or fourth and you will be straight on the ride. Stay ahead of the crowds and you can ride all day no fast pass required. Every ride we went to had an indicated wait time of 5mins whilst some we walked past were and hour! 
Don’t miss the waterworkd show it’s awesome. 
Jurasic park ride you will get very wet and you can by a single use poncho if you don’t want to get wet they are about $5 each and very flimsy so I doubt you could wear it more than once. Save your money get wet cool down ,it’s always hot and feel good that you didn’t contribute another massive piece of plastic to the oceans of the world.

Battlestar Galactica (both red and blue - blue is much better we went 3 times in a row!)

We took photos at the globe, checked again the height requirement posted outside of the gate, and walked around for 30 min, all shops still closed. At 9.45 the gate was already opened and we were like 10 in line, better get there sooner next time to be among the 1st (yes, I'm a freak). When it actually opened we (wife, husband, 2 children aged 2 and 4 in stroller), went straight to treasure hunter. We were number 1 there, the children loved it, then we went to mummy area, I forgot what we did here but I didn't remember went into anything because it was not suitable for my children's height. Then we passed the Jurassic park as well because it was opened at 11 and by that time it was still closed. Went straight to enchanted airways, no queque, went straight to the jet coaster, can't believe my 2 yo can be in this quite terrifying jet coaster and she loved it. My 4 yo has been on mild coaster in Disneyland Tokyo and Sea and in her opinion and mine this one is scarier. Went to Shrek 4D also no line (we prioritized these attractions knowing the lines will be long in the afternoon), the kids loved this. Puss in Boot only with my 4 yo, not as scary as the Enchanted airways. She liked this one. My 2 yo was waiting in the shop and can ride small ferris wheel inside (it said opened at 11 but it opened sooner at that time), Then we went to jurassic park at opening at 11 am, most people went straight to the right toward the boat attraction (I forgot the name, but this is the main attraction there) but we went to canopy flyer instead. Also not as scary as the coaster, thought both my children said it was scary. Only small line here, then went to Dino Soar next to it, the children loved this one. My 4 yo and me then went to queque in the boat thing, it said 15 min, but it was 1 hour long. We used our pochos here, glad we did because my child just got better from flu. My 4yo loved this one. She once waited 2 hour in disneyland when she was 3 for the critter attraction (with water splash too) so I know she can handle this one (in heat and patiently). While waiting my husband watched the velociraptor and stayed cool in the foodcourd. I followed them to the foodcourt, ordered the kids menu of dino shaped nuggets and smiley faced fries, the kids loved it. The parents ate chicken rice and it tasted okay really. Then we went to Madagaskar, ate Bingsu (really big) there. The children didn't want to watch Elmo or ride merry go round (strange right?), we went to the attraction on the right thay was like it's a small world though darker. We  went to New York and did the spaghetti chase and live action by Steven Spielberg. The kids loved both but of course the impact of the live! action! was bigger for them. Then we went to Accelerator in Sci Fi just in time to watched Waterworld at 15.45 (the show only has 2 time slots and 16.15 was the last), people actually running for this. And I also followed suit with 1 kid each because we have to leave the stroller near the entrance gate. BUT DUE TO BAD WEATHER THE SHOW WAS CANCELLED AFTER 15 MIN. There was no raining only dark clouds but after watching the rest of the show in you tubes they have lots of fire so I imagined it is possible to get struck by lighting... at least in my mind t

Während man dort mittlerweile gut und gerne $100 und mehr für einen Eintritt bezahlt sind es hier gerade mal s$50. Das sollte man sich bewusst sein, wenn man die beiden Parks vergleicht.

Wir waren sicher schon 4x in den amerikanischen Universal Studios, weshalb wir unbedingt das asiatische Pendant sehen mussten.

Wir waren wochentags da und gönnten uns aufgrund des ""günstigen"" Eintritts den ExpressPass. Über dessen Nutzen waren wir geteilter Meinung. Als Beispiel kamen wir bei Jurassic Park nach 7 Minuten zum Zug während die reguläre Wartezeit 70(!) Minuten betragen hätte. Bei anderen Bahnen war die Wartezeit nur 10 Minuten, weshalb sich kein grosser Vorteil ergab. Die Mitarbeiter gaben sich aber grosse Mühe und setzten uns wenn immer möglich in die erste Reihe. Unter dem Strich ist der Express Pass für uns ein KANN aber kein MUSS. Es gibt einen gewissen Komfort, wir wären an diesem Tag aber auch ohne auf alle Attraktionen gekommen.

Auch sonst gefiel uns der Park. Sauber, stimmig und schön gemacht.

The biggest problem was a rides which are very slow compared to big name attraction parks around the world - Battlestar Galactica was total disaster, very slow and boring  and they have the most stupid regulations – you must leave all your money and bags in locker what is free of charge for one hour, but during day there was  waiting time around one hour, so it is not clear how you can get your bag back if your do not have any money needed to open… Also finger scan was not reliable as system did not recognized original finger, but luckily for us opened the locker with different finger In other attractions there was pin codes that was more reliable, so my guess they were collecting visitors finger scans!  The only ride that 9 year girl find interesting with some adrenaline in the whole park was Revenge of the Mummy, that we did 3 times – stated queue times were not very accurate – for some rides it stated that we must wait 10 minutes, but actual time was around 30 minutes, but for some other attraction there was no queue at all although at the entrance the waiting time was 30 minutes. The only ride we did not manage was Treasure Hunters which had waiting time over 1 hour, but as this was for toddlers we were not disappointed.
As the rides were very dull then we spent most of the time in shows – WaterWorld we watched twice in this was top notch performance and I think is the best thing in this attraction park. Lights, Camera, Action!™ Hosted by Steven Spielberg show was short but again impressive with surprises – the biggest problem there was long waiting time. 
Do not miss Look out! Velociraptors have escaped in Jurassic Park! as they looked very realistic – again great performance.
Eating was OK although not cheap, but kid gets some souvenirs at the same time so no need to go outside only to save 5-6 SGD. There is water refill point so bring some empty bottle (they did not checked bags at the entrance at all).
And be advised that they have most stupid online booking system that is not simply working – even after transactions is approved by bank there is no tickets issued and luckily – also no money deducted so in the end you need still go to ticket box on buy tickets at the full price – might be mastercard server problem as Resorts World Sentosa are relying on mastercard – for me it looked that mastercard is using very old online system.
So in the end we spend around 8 hours in park, shows were great, also park was clean and staff was superbly friendly and smiling but because of rides I would not recommend to visit universal studio – there are much more better things to do in Singapore or in Sentosa Resort. Maybe if this is your first attraction park or you have toddlers, then you can have different experience.",Boring and most overrated attraction,2019-03-01,FAMILY,Gints K,"Riga, Latvia",Riga,Latvia,0

Didnt managed to try the most exciting cyclone ride as the waiting time was extended to 70mins on a weekday. The shrek dragon ride gave me quite abit of adrenaline. The mummy ride seems familiar to 1 of the rides i took at Tokyo DisneySea. Went to the Elmo show where its catered to mainly kids. Language used is English. Elmo ride will be very good for toddlers too. The Madagascar ride had a ""scary"" ending. Haha the 2 tourists were scrambling for umbrella/ponchos when the cart we were in was approaching a mini waterfall, afraid of being drenched in water. You will understand what i mean after you have taken the ride. Food inside was quite expensive. I ate a burger with fries set costing S$15.

They really are most welcoming and helpful staff I have ever met. The park has a reasonable number of rides which gives you time to enjoy your day at leisure without having to run around so as not to miss rides. We got the tickets from Klook so really hassle free. I don't find it worth taking the cable car to there. The Sentosa express is just find. We did not get the express pass and it was just fine as it was week day. The queues were manageable. Some tips:

- Everyone rushes to the Transformers ride as soon as the park opens. We did too and waited for almost 1 hour. However at around noon waiting time was only 5 mins. So better wait to go during the day.
- The Waterworld show is amazing. Do check the timing and plan your day such that you don't miss it.
- There are raincoats on sale for SGD 5 at the shop next to the Jurassic park rapids adventure. Do get it you won't regret. We wish we saw if before our ride. Our clothes and shoes were all drenched. But don't miss this ride. It's really great.
- The queue did not seem to end at the Cylon ride. But The Human roller coaster was around 5 mins waiting time during the last hour before the park closes.

This place didn’t disappoint. We unfortunately were delayed in our arrival here so only had about 5 and 1/2 hrs at the park (closes at 7pm mon-thur). 

We tried to go on as many rides as possible which was tricky since a lot of them had long wait/queue times, some even up to 90 mins!

Managed to go on about 5 rides. They have a few smaller rides aimed at younger children which aren’t that wild or scary. I went on the puss in boots ride which was a rollercoaster and lots of fun. The Shrek 4D And transformers 4D were also very clever. I went on one of the large Sci-Fi City rollercoasters (Battlestar Galactica CYLON grey track) that goes upside down 5 times and has a corkscrew. Misleading wait time said 10 mins but was actually closer to 45 mins as the wait time indicator board outside wasn’t computerised and had to be updated manually and obviously hadn’t been updated for a while. This ride unfortunately made me feel so sick afterwards that I couldn’t enjoy the rest of the rides I went on afterwards. 

Lots of gift shops, overpriced and also many of the deals require you to purchase multiple products from a range rather than single items. 

Food choices aren’t great and also overpriced. We were fortunate to get a $5 food voucher when we purchased our tickets online beforehand so these made our $16 meal go down to $11. 

The waterworld stunt show was impressive but a bit too violent for my liking. There are labelled seating areas in the auditorium which specify if you will get splashed on, drenched with water or stay dry as the show takes place in water.

    The place that impressed me most in this tour was Universal Studios. Every event here was interesting, so there was a long queue for almost every event. My sister and I enjoy doing exciting things, so we lined up for the roller coaster. After about half an hour, we began to play the roller coaster. I felt very excited when the roller coaster was climbing. The car began to accelerate and I heard a deafening scream. I like the scenery when the roller coaster was high, I like the blue sky and the white clouds. If you do not want to play exciting games, there are many other projects here, and you can always find the right one.
    In the afternoon of that day, we watched a 4D movie in Universal Studios. 4D movies are a feature of Universal Studios. It is very cool! I felt like that I was in the film. The chairs in the cinema would move with the action and would occasionally blow. It was so interesting that many spectators shouted out. If you come to Singapore, highly suggest you come here.
If you don not want to play in fun parks, you can walk along the beach in Singapore, the sand is very soft here. Of course, you can also swim in the sea.

There is a lot of different things to do for everyone. If you don’t like the rides you can always go around the area and watch those live performances/shows or go to Pantages theatre to see Sesame Street mini musical. 
Or you can go and watch Shrek 4D movie experience. 

The rides are amazing! There is two big rollercoasters, Mummy ride, Transformers ride and lots of other rides for you to take. 
There is also two water rides which I didn’t took. 

In Water World show make sure you know which areas are “soaked”, “might get wet” and so called safe zones. 

After I took Mummy and Transformers ride I was so amused and caught my self thinking how did they do that with all the visual effects and 3D videos. You just have to experience it. They were amazing. 

Even though Singapore is the most expensive city in Asia and the express pass at Universal Studios sets you back 129S$ (79S$ admission + 50S$ express pass) I’d say it’s worth it. I was in the Universal Studios on Monday before noon and there was already 40 minutes lines to some rides. Later afternoon the waiting times were 40-75 minutes so it’s nice to cut the line with express pass. I can imagine the amount of people there on weekends and holidays. 

You can bring your own food and drinks to area. The food they sell there is not very good and drinks are quite highly priced but that’s how amusement parks work. I had an average burger combo for 16S$.

- Transformers ride
- Lights! Camera! Action! by Steven Spielberg
- Water World stunt show.

Even if you're with your family, there are some rides which even they can enjoy and aren't fueled with scares. If you're visiting Singapore, do not even think about missing this one! You'll need a whole day here, so make sure you add this to your itinerary.

Special mention rides...

The Mummy: This one was one hell of a ride. First you need to take a long walk inside the structure and then there you reach to a dark cave like roller coaster which takes you to the Egyptian times taking you up down and all the sides in high speed in the dark. Gosh!!! Still can't get over it...went 2 times in this 

Transformers: The best 4D experience ever! The moving coaster with 3D screens literally made us feel that we are in middle of the fight. This one is even 10 times better than the one at Ferrari World Abu Dhabi. Greatest advantage of this ride is that even the elder people can enjoy this who are scared of roller coasters. It will be a supreme delight for them.

Jurassic world: (EXPECT A VERY LONG WAITING TIME) Yeah, you read the brackets right! We waited for almost 2 hrs in the queue. It's a tube boat coaster which takes you through the jurassic jungle with robotic dinosaurs. After experiencing it, I felt like it's here from where the inspiration for The Rajasaurus ride in Imagica has been taken from. If you've been to Rajasaurus in Imagica, it's pretty much the same but in open air and a few bumps in the river like in tube slides in a water park.

There were 2 high speed roller coasters as well (forgot their names). The red line coaster was fast but not awesome kinds.
The grey line takes your breath away by swirling you around and taking you through the ground between the fog! Grey one was awesome!

If you are OK with rides, or untested, this has a wide enough selection to help you decide whether you are an adrenaline seeker or not. Cy-Lon is the most hardcore it gets in this park so plan accordingly.

I rode everything worth riding:

Sesame Street coaster - is good for kids; but over really too quickly ,;D
Transformers Ride - surprised the kids weren't freaked out, really good '4D' ride
Puss n' Boots coaster - kid friendly but throws the stomach around more than you'd think
The Mummy Ride - it's fast-ish coaster ride in the dark, and not much of the horror house 'BOO' as I would have wanted. 
Jurassic Park - good, over very quickly and you may well get wet. Bring a parka
Battlestar Galactica: HUMAN - might be at your limit if you're not into 'coasters
Battlestar Galactica: CY-LON - might be at your limit or just beyond. Because of the loops and screws, it's more disorienting than HUMAN, for some that means 'NO WAY' but I thought the G's were more noticeable on HUMAN. That said I've definitely ridden more ominous rides

Food and drink options are relatively good and not crazy expensive like comparable parks. As you'd expect from Sg as a whole I think.

2,651963777,2019-02-12,MOBILE,5,"eight years ago when we lived in Japan, we came to Universal Studios twice on vacation.  For the past year and a half, since moving to Singapore, my family has held season passes to Universal Studios. 

The park does a really nice job of keeping things current and having special holiday programming. “Halloween horror nights” for example, is very well done. They turn some of the non-ride areas into themed haunted houses. 
* please note that there is an extra charge for Halloween horror nights even for passholders. In general this is for teens or adults and can be VERY frightening for younger children. 

We have gone Universal enough times to make the passes worthwhile! We really enjoy all of the rides as they are generally good for a range of children ages 8 to 18 (of course there are also a few rides for smaller children). 

When buying a season pass, definitely consider the Express Pass. This will allow you to bypass the general admission line and get on the rides quicker. For certain rides, they have a “single rider,” which means if your party wants to stand together in line, but doesn’t care if you go on the same ride at the same time, you can also bypass longer lines. 
* Not every ride has “express” or “single rider” options.

The park is always very clean and the rides seem to be operated safely. The food is usually decent but overpriced since it is a theme park. Do note that some vendors don’t take credit cards and only deal in Singapore cash. Specifically, the iced-slushy vendor - which is a favorite.  

The Indian food set across from the mummy ride is very good, my kids love the Dino nuggets near Jurassic Park, and my kids like the green Shrek waffles.

The Transformers ride is a three-dimensional experience so be wary if you get motion sick. I always take 1/2 of a Dramamine before going to this park so that I can enjoy all of the adventure rides happily!

Also note, you will get WET on the Jurassic park River Adventure! Your stuff will get WET on the Jurassic Park River Adventure. Your raft will flood. So, bring a plastic garbage bag, or rain poncho if you don’t want you and your things to get wet, and don’t put anything on the floor of the raft.

Tiketnya bisa dibeli langsung di USS atau membeli melalui Traveloka/Klook (biasanya lebih murah melalui online). Perjalanan dari tengah kota ke Sentosa bisa menggunakan MRT ke Stasiun Harbourfront lalu menaiki Sentosa Express dengan biaya 4 SGD. Selain menggunakan Sentosa Express terdapat satu alternatif yang lebih murah yaitu menggunakan bis. Bis yang biasa dipakai yaitu RWS208 bisa naik melalui bus stand yang ada di Vivo City Shopping, biayanya 1 SGD. Sayangnya, kalian harus menyediakan waktu yang lebih untuk menunggu bis menuju Sentosa.
Tips ke USS agar bisa mencoba semua wahana adalah sampai disana pagi-pagi lalu langsung mengantri di depan pintu masuk. Masuki dulu wahana yang biasanya ramai diserbu orang seperti Transformer dan Revenge of the Mummy (kalau sudah antriannya mengular biasanya mennggu hingga lebih dari 1 jam).

1,649950750,2019-02-03,MOBILE,4,"This park is beautiful, and quite complete, but we felt it was a bit expensive for what we got back.
We went in January, when there are only two long days a week (closing at 10 pm), only one of which there was a parade AND fireworks planned. 
However, due to a potential weather issue (note that it did not even rained a drop), they cancelled both. After googling, it appears this happens frequently and it does not surprise me as it rains in Singapore more often than not.
I mean, I get it, it makes sense. But I post this for others to think about this when choosing when to go and why.
We had the longest queues on that day and a long wait until 10:15 pm on the heat with the kids only to be dissapointed after announcements of delays and then cancellations of the special events the whole day.
Anyways, if you are a fan of theme parks like us, you'd do the park twice. Then on the bright side, you can upgrade your ticket to a seasonal pass for only 30 SGD and go again and again if your stay allows. Just go to the membership office next to the entrance during your visit and in ten minutes you walk out with your card, even if you are a tourist!

31,649430499,2019-01-31,OTHER,4,"Here is my detail review of Universal Studio Singapore ,  which will help you and guide you ,  (please give a thumbs up if you like it ) , 

1)  Its located at world resort sentosa ,   you can go there easily by Taxi ,  Grab Taxi ,,  or  by  any tour guide service or  by cable car  from Vivo Mall ,  

2)  we took Grab taxi , which charged me around 12 S$  from orchid road ,  (me ,  my wife and a 2 year toddler) , 

3) I didn't chose  any guide service ,  because they would pickup me at hotel around 8 30 am ,  and  just drop me there ,  no service back to hotel ,     so I chose grab taxi (UBER) , and went there with ease , and cheap , 

4) Taxi dropped us at basement ,  we took elevator

5)  there are  4 to 5 windows for tickets  ,  i went there on 23rd dec  (peak time of tourists) ,  it was like  30 people at the queue , but it was moving fast , due to 5 windows , 

6)  we bought 1 express pass (120 $) ,  1 normal pass (80 $)  ,    (toddler ticket  free) ,  we really made mistake in buying the tickets ,  , which i will tell you later 

7)   this theme park consist of 6 themes ,  from entrance if you go left , you will find Madagascar ,  or  if you go right from entrance , you will find hollywood , and seasame street , 

8)  I preferred to kick-off my visit by going left ,  (Madagascar) ,  

9)  there was a slow boat ride ,  (toddler can enjoy as well) ,  but there were  sooo many people ,   express queue was only 10 people ,   but normal queue was like 100 to 150 people ,  we can't take the express queue  as we only have  1 express ,   it took us  1 hour for normal queue ,  

10)  so if you going in holiday period or weekends ,  i strongly recommend the express pass ,   1 time express is around 120 $ ,   unlimited  express is around 220$ ,    

11)  for 1 time time express , they will provide a card with  all rides names mentioned ,  when you take any ride from express queue ,  they just tik the name of that ride , so that we cannot use it again  by express , 

benefit was that m my wife  enjoyed few rides so did I also enjoyed the remaining , 

12)  but unlimited pass , the just tied a band on your wrist ,   so that  only  1 person can use it , 

13)  well , after Madagascar ,   we went to Sherk theme,  which was ok , if not  best , ,  

14)  then  we went to lost world theme ,  beautifully build ,  there is stunt show  3 times a day ,  which was really amazing , (i dnt remember the timings ) ,  

15)  there was a also a slow merry-go-round ride  which was perfect for my toddler , 

16)  the we enter the Egypt mummy theme area ,    wow ,  what a splendid architecture , 

17) there was a dark horror ride , which was really awesome and scary , but not recommend for toddler 

18)  all theme parks  have restaurants ,   egypt theme park  have  halaal indian restaurant as well , i think only  2 halal restaurant in entire USS 

19)   then we enter science fiction theme area ,     we has  best ride of USS ,   called  transporter ,   we enter that area around 4 pm ,  there was not much long queue at transporter ,  (there is a TIP  ,  this ride also has a option for single person queue , which is also shorter  same as express pass queue , ) ,  

20)  then we enter hollywood area,   beautifully built ,  there was artificial snow there sometimes ,  really amazing ,   must see the ""light-camera-action show directed by Steven Spielberg,     and sesame street ride ""spaghetti"", recommended for toddlers  , 

21)  there was huge  parade in the evening , with all USS characters, 

22) there were also arcade games area in hollywood theme, 

 we didn't finished all 6 parks completely , but if you buy express pass , u can finish the park for sure , 

My TIPS ,  

1)  Dont take any guide service , it will bound you to go early morning , 

2) Begin the park from left ,  ""madagascar"" ,  then you will finish it on hollywood in the evening ,  which look really wonderful  in evening , 

3) go for express pass  if you have money ,  you can enjoy all rides  in a day , 

4)  don't go for unlimited pass ,  as its too expensive ,  and there are too many rides to enjoy , no sense to enjoy just 1 ride time to time , 

5) wear rain coat in jurrasic park boat ride , which they sell at 5$ ,  otherwise you may go soaked , 

6) you can get rental stroller for toddler on cheap rates at entrance , 

7)  exit the park 30 mins  before , inorder to have short queue at taxi , (but GRAB  is the best option there , cheap and hassle free) , 

8) you can also exit park and re-enter  at any time,  but believe me  you dont have time to exit ,    there are lots of activities etc there ,   even with express park , you can't ride everything or enjoy all shows , 

Please ask any question , i will answer you , 

Give this review a thumbs up , if its help you  "")

I would suggest you spend your time and money doing something else. Unless you’re the type of person you likes standing around in lines. If you enjoy traffic jams on highways then this place is right up your alley. 

To make it worse, it’s in Singapore, which means you’re not only standing around in lines but you’re doing it with a heap of pushy asians. I got here at 11:00am and at 14:00 I had ridden two rides.

Lines were about 30-45mins long but we didn’t go on the big attractions like the Battlestar Galactica or Transformers which had lines over an hour long. However I really recommend getting the Xpress pass so you get more out of your day and don’t have to deal with whining kids. 

My main gripe from the day was the Sesame Street show, which my 3 year old was really getting into. Then for some reason, halfway through, it stopped suddenly and we were told to leave the building with no reason given other than a “technical difficulty.” I really think that for supposedly being an “award winning stage show” the actors should have been professional enough to keep going and improvise, instead of disappointing hundreds of little kids with no proper explanation given. 

For food- there are lots of over priced Chinese or deep fried options around. I’d recommend stepping out of there and exploring all the other options close by. 

In terms of kids- Toilets are always close by and all seemed to have a baby change facility. Prams are handy to have as there is a lot of walking to do for little feet, otherwise you can also hire one. There are drink fountains everywhere so it might be advantageous to bring some water bottles in and fill them up while you’re there to save $ (drinks are expensive in there!). Im thankful we brought in little fans with a mist spray as it got hot in the lines and the kids would have something else to complain about.

We ended up spending about 8 hours there and could have easily spent longer if the kids weren’t so tired. It was an expensive day out but in the end I think we got our money’s worth.

Because we like the more extreme roller coasters (and not fans of queuing in the humidity), we got the express pass unlimited.  Longest queue we were ever in for any ride was 10 min.  We went to Battlestar Galactica Human and Cylon rides first.  With the express pass, we were able to ride both once before the rides shut down due to technical issue.  They thankfully reopened later in the afternoon but had they not, we would have been very appreciative of having the express pass.  The Waterworld show was fun to watch.  This Universal Studios is quite small compared to the one in Orlando, so you could probably get through everything in half a day (with express pass).  We rode everything multiple times (some rides many times) and found enough fun to spend the entire park opening hours there.  The park gets noticeably quieter around 5 pm when families with small kids start heading off. The rides that require no bags or loose items will have free locker rental.  The amount of free locker rental time is adjusted throughout the day in accordance with queuing time.  For example for Human/Cyclon, at park opening the free locker time was 45 min.  At 2 pm, it was 95 min.  At 5 pm, it was 65 min.  On rides where lockers are optional (i.e. Rapids), you will have to pay (i.e. $4 for 1 hour).  We took a Grab car on the way there, and a taxi back to our hotel.  Both Grab and taxi were about the same cost for two people as using public transportation, but took half the travel time and provided gloriously cool air con.

15-30 mins wait for almost every attraction is heaven! Those who loves to go to Disney or Universal would understand what i’m trying to say.
You don’t need to actually pay extra ,since the waiting time won’t take hours.

You will get wet on the Jurassic Park ride, but for $5 you can hire a poncho. Why they don’t just give these out as you board the ride is beyond me, and smacks of further money gouging. If you do get soaked, there are drying cabinets at the end of the ride, but they slug you $5 for that as well. 
All in all an enjoyable day, the rides are ok but not many for adrenaline junkies. Really enjoyed the Shrek 4D and the Transformers ride. The roller coaster could cause you to lose your lunch so plan your timing on riding this.

You have to wait in the queue for more than an hour sometimes. However, if you get the VIP ticket, you can get the priority to enter. But still there is queue as quite a number of people buy VIP tickets. I loved the roller coaster, The Mummy and transformers. Foods are way too expensive. Water costs about SGD7 for 350ml/500ml (can't remember). The entry ticket price varies from one website to other. But if you purchase ticket directly from the counter there is expensive, compare to the internet price. Better you purchase ticket online as some of the offers include transports.

If you want to try all the rides, it will take your whole day. There is no point going to universal studios at 8am. It opens at 10am. You can start at 9am after taking a nice breakfast. You can take photos outside and then wait in the queue to enter. Do not carry any food items with you as they through all food items. They check your backpacks at the entrance. But you can carry water bottle. And you must carry water bottle otherwise you have to spend quite a lot money on water.

Before going to queue for any roller coaster, make sure you get a locker. Otherwise you have to come all the way out to put your stuffs in the locker and be the queue all over again. The locker is free for 1st one hour I guess, then it's chargeable. So if you are travelling more than one person, take one locker and keep all your belongings and then after an hour or one ride get another locker with another person thumb print.

The main issue with the park is one expected of every park; food and drinks are overpriced (but not when considering prices in other theme parks). 

I recommend using a pin when accessing a locker as fingerprints are removed from the system once your session expires; we needed to ask for it to be opened by a worker but they were excellent in their service (as most employees were).

2,645040854,2019-01-10,OTHER,5,"As SIngaporeans, we had never visited the USS before so the trip on 10 Jan 2019 was something we were looking forward to. Bringing four kids (aged one half months to 6 years old) was challenging (given the Singapore heat) but overall the visit to USS was a very pleasant experience. 
Pros:
- Very good toilet facilities. having lots of water coolers all over the park helped saved a ton of money as we did not have to buy the pricey soft drinks. 
- Going at a off peak period, it was generally enjoyable as the smaller rides were empty. This is very good for families with young kids, generally we did not have to wait more than 5-10 minutes (without express pass).
- Park was stroller friendly and the generally small size of the park meant that we could revisit places we missed pretty easily.
- Friendly staff and the ""child swop"" option allowed us to take turns to join our kids on certain rides without having to queue all over again.

Tips to enjoy the park
- Bring a water tumbler. Given the hot Singapore weather, you will need to top up your bottle at least 4-5 times a day. Having a water tumbler saves money on buying pricey soft drinks. 
- The food in the USS premises is very expensive, just go out of the park to eat and you save at least $5-$6 per meal. It takes less than 15 minutes to reach the entrance from the farthest point of the park. If you are like us with a family of 6, you get to save at least $40-$50 just by walking a little more
- Have a late breakfast or eat something substantial before you go into the park (assuming at 10am). That way you can have your lunch about 2-3pm in which you are able to avoid the sizeable lunch crowd.
- If there are certain rides you want to take but couldn't because of the long queue, go during the water world show (at 1pm or 415pm) as that the period where many visitors are watching the show thus considerably shortening the queue at those rides.",Excellent experience,2019-01-01,FAMILY,benjyboy81,,,,1

Later the day the wait was up to one and a half hours for the beat rides. That was also due to the fast track which does not cost too much, if I remember and allows you to skip to the front of the line. I get the point, but it was super annoying, especially due to the locker system. They want you to put backpacks into lockers. Depending on how busy the park is, the time varies (more time for free in the evening). You get like 45 min for free and if you’re not back in time, you have to pay for rent and it’s not too cheap. The problem is, I left my cash and cards in the locker and due to long lines took longer than 45 min. A nice gentlemen lend us a couple of dollars to get the stuff out and then we could pay back.

We were not able to go to every show/rides because we spent so much time queuing up, and by 6 pm, my son was dead tired. I would have bought the Express ticket if I had known of the option.

Food: quite pricey within USS, you could have got cheaper option just outside the USS compound. We did not take the latter option because of the long queues at every show/rides.

Another favorite show was Waterworld- it was amazing! The actors, the explosions and stunts made us go WOW! Plus it was fun seeing people getting wet (good  thing I was only on the splash zone). All time favorite show.
3rd fave was Jurassic Park adventure, but people on the ride I was with got extremely wet. They had to change clothes  or use the dry pod for SGD 5. Ponchos are for sale for SGD10 lockers for rent for SGD 4 for an hour.
Some attractions though, like the mummy and have free lockers for an hour. Both attractions are pretty strict, no bags, or phones or wallets in your pocket.

Cons:
the street show was okay but not as magical as TDR. We saw them for only a few minutes and they stopped at a place where a lot couldn’t see the performance.
Many things were expensive- food and souvenirs (SGD 2 for a penny and about SGD 35 for a USS shirt).

I also stayed for the new year's fireworks which were a nice way to ring in the new year. Some tips for travelers who want to avoid crowds:
1. GO EARLY. Most people don't rock up to the park until 1-2pm or later which is peak time. The park opened at 10 and we were lined up at 9:30. We did an entire circuit of the park and the main big rides (the mummy, both battlestar galactica coasters, Jurassic park, shrek) plus watching the waterworld show and were done by 12:30 with wait times a max 10min. So get in early and you don't wait much at all. 

2. Bring an umbrella because there may be thunderstorms and you will get wet. 

3. Don't bother with ponchos for the Jurassic park ride as you barely get wet and they charge you $5 for them. 

4. Consider where you are - burgers are the only western food options and all the other food is beautiful unless you don't like Chinese, Indian or Malaysian cuisine. Also it's theme park food so obviously it's more expensive than usual. 

5. Do intense rides at the start of the day because you're more likely to get motion sickness when you're tired and/or full so get the roller coasters and the transformers ride done early.","Great Fun on NYE, great theming",2019-01-01,FRIENDS,Pioneer749079,,,,0

We booked a return van transfer as we were concerned about getting there and back during New Years. This cost us $170 sgd return for 5 people. The journey there was really smooth and I would now suggest grab a taxi instead of a booked transfer. We left for the park at 4.15pm. We purchased the ‘after 5pm ticket package’ so couldn’t enter the park until after 5. The park was already busy though with day time guests. The park itself is good but does lack a lot of rides for teenagers. There’s really only 4 that I would class as ‘adult’ type rides. 
The food at the park is awful. Really expensive and if you prefer western food there is very limited choices and the choices there are very ordinary.
We bought the unlimited fast passes which cost an additional $100 per person and I didn’t think this represented very good value at all. Most of the rides you wouldn’t want to go on a second time apart from the big roller coasters. Waiting time at the most was around 45 mins for normal pass holders but it was good getting the fast passes to save time. It depends on how long you want to wait for a ride as to whether a fast pass is worth the extra $$.

This review is for the first time visitors and ones who have at least six hours to spare in Universal Studios. 
1. Buy tickets online. You will save about ten dollars. 
2. Reach early, may be by 11. 
3. Carry minimum things with you. 
4. Carry food and water, if possible. The studio's restaurants appear expensive. 
5. The place is a roundabout route so you start from the entry. 
6. There are free lockers available inside. The free time is about an hour. Locker security are of two types: fingerprint and secret info based. 
7. If you are going in a group, you can use a new member to set up a locker. Otherwise locker fee is S$2 for 20 minutes. 
8. Do ride roller-coaster. We did Cylon. Do it at the end of your trip because you will feel imbalanced after the ride. 
9. Broadway Street is the most happening place here. 
10. We did Madagascar ride, Shrek movie, Egyptian ride and The Lost World. Only Egyptian roller-coaster is good. 
11. Outside the studio, there are many options for food. You can skip eating inside and pick the restaurant outside. It's cheaper and less crowded. 
12. We missed the Transformers ride. It is supposed to be the best. Please do try. 
13. To go home by MRT, walk to the Merlion and take the mono rail. Else you will have to wait in a long queue at Universal Studios.

The reason for the average rating is the small size of the park compared to similar venues around the world.

Like many parks there are some draw card rides and events but most of the venue focuses on selling merchandise and food as the money spinners.

FYI: Weather, be warned if a storm come in, which happens a lot in Singapore, they shut down all the outdoor rides. 
Also I would recommend arriving early afternoon as the queues really disappear in the last couple of hours (at least they did in our 1 off visit). 
The best rides by far are the Battlestar Galactica rollacosters. After the storm, during the last hour of the parks opening time we had 0 waiting time for many of the rides, so we repeated rides or went back to worlds were the queues were really long during the day.

4,642043175,2018-12-28,MOBILE,1,"We had a very frustrating and disappointing experience at Singapore Universal Studios. We’ve visited lots of different theme parks around Asia and this compared very poorly to the rest. I could go into a rant about how we felt that day, but I’ll limit it to a list of pros and cons!

Pros:
- it looks beautiful and was very clean
- well themed areas
- the shows were great - Waterworld was awesome
- lots of shade and seating
- the food was priced quite reasonably for a theme park
- there were a group of 4 singers in the street who sung some fantastic Christmas songs - full of energy.

Cons:
- everything seemed to be about getting you to part with more money. Things like the monorail should surely be free.
- queue times are a lie (double them)
- you are forced to use lockers for your bags when going on most rides. You have to pay a lot for the lockers and the price balloons if you queue for a while. It’s almost like you’re paying an entrance fee to the park as well as paying for each ride
- not enough vendors for drinks/food. 30 minute queues for a snack and 20 minutes queues just for a drink! Not good on a hot day.
- for some reason, Single-rider queues were not open. Staff kept saying “they will be open later”, but we checked and checked but it never happened. No idea why they didn’t open them - frustrating.
- we found that the staff were in general very rude through the day. Not what you would expect in a theme park where you usually have buoyant people who thank you and are willing to help. Instead, the staff often grunted at us or pointed.
- express tickets were crazy prices - triple what we paid to get in. We’re not sure whether they were discouraging single-riders so that people would go and desperately buy express tickets to get on the rides - a conspiracy theory! However, the express tickets didn’t even seem to speed things up by much. We overhead a normal 85 minute queue (for a kids’ ride) would be reduced to 40 minutes for express - still a huge wait and unlikely to actually be under an hour.
- we saw a lot of disgruntled children around the park and I daresay it was due to the lack of things for them to do. We felt really sorry for them.
- drinks prices were expensive. For a hot country, they should be making more water fountains available. Other attractions in Singapore really focus on sustainability and encourage people to refill bottles with water rather than wasting plastic.
- there was even a huge queue to get off Sentosa! Little tip, if you walk down to the next station along on the Sentosa Express, there are no queues there so you can hop on the monorail and get out of Sentosa quickly!
- too overcrowded. Universal, please don’t let this many people in! Half the amount of people = double the fun!

I would really discourage spending a day here. Singapore has much more to offer. You’ll end up spending lots of money and have little to show for it in Universal. We were one of the first few inside the park and left at 4ish after the Waterworld show. I think we managed about 2 rides (The Mummy and a Transformers simulator) and saw the Special Effects show and Waterworld show. 4 things in 6 hours.

On food: the food is at least 3 times higher than outside food and many were serving process or fast foods..we end up eating nuggets and burgers for lunch and dinner..the kids meal come with the gift set , for today's its a container but the container was not able to latch when closed
The toilets are not so pleasant too..it's wet with tissues all over, the garbage bins are full according to my wife when visiting the ladies. For me the males toilet was acceptable although there are some which was wet. 
The worst part is the staffs
 I saw ,.while queuing for a boat ride in far far land 4 young girls in their 7 to 9 was shouted by a staff for what the staff claimed that they used others fast pass. Instead of politely turn then down  he shouted at them with question :"" is this picture in the card look like you ? Don't use others card and q here. You are taking other people place""..I know he might be right but just a simple reply to say that the fast pass is not  transferable would be a better and polite way of replying? The 4 girls  was so scared that they just ran out quickly .it is a bit embassaring too as they are quite a lot of ppl queuing at that time
 I too had my embarrassing moment when i had dinner at mel's drive thru.. I paid some 70 dollars for food and drinks and filling in my soft drinks at the self service machine. When i came over refill again one of the staff shouted at me that i did not pay 3 Dollar for refill. She is shouting from the far right counter while i was refiling at the other end..She shouted in front of so many people on the queue and so.many people refilling...I was so embarrassed that i follow her to her counter, on the far right. I apologise that i was not aware that refilling require to pay extra..i saw so many people refilling some with their own bottle and some even with the minion container they purchased hence I thought it was FOC
I was asking her what is the fuss of shouting for a mere 3 dollar when she can just tell (and not shout)..her reply was rather simple,  it it was written at the displace at payment counter,  but seriously and humbly i did not see that. She then made me wait at the counter as she continue with they payment of the other customers before processing my payment ( imagine this.: she was taking orders from a customer when she saw me refilling , shouted at me and bring me to her counter , then continue serving the customer before attending to me: the 5 minutes was the most embarrassed moment of my life.

I have been to DisneyLand Anaheim & Paris, Universal Studios in LA and Movie World in Queensland, Australia, and I would rate them way higher than USS. These places have much better systems for ride “queueing” and seem to genuinely care that their guests have a good time. That was not our experience at USS.
The only thing we enjoyed was Lights, Camera, Action, and the WaterWorld show was pretty good.
We chose not to line up for a minimum of one hour & twenty minutes for the “good” rides - some rides were a two hour wait (we don’t believe any ride is worth wasting that amount of time for) and also chose not to buy a fast pass for ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY DOLLARS EACH!!!!! (And that was single use, multiple use was SGD160)
What I have since found out is the fast pass increases in price depending on demand, obviously in VERY high demand the day we visited.
Also, the service is incredibly SLOW. There appeared to be no sense of urgency at any place we bought food or drinks from, even though they had endless streams of people to serve. And as with most theme parks expect to pay double, if not triple, for food & drinks.
So lessons learnt, do not bother going at holiday time, buy your entry tickets AND fast passes online BEFORE you get there, and don’t expect to be served quickly. Also remember in Singapore it is HOT!!!

Begitu banyak tempayt yang bagus, restoran dan tempat-tempat dengan pemandangan indah, serta berbagai area rekreasi yang banyak. Namun sayang, kami ke sini hanya sebentar, untuk makan siang dan sekadar jalan-jalan selama setengah jam saja.

Akhirnya, kami makan siang dengan makanan yang disediakan travel, mengambil tempat di tempat duduk di tengah area Universal Studio, dekat globe Universal Studio. Cukup nyaman karena tempatnya teduh namun terbuka, sehingga angin sepoi-sepoi pun menyambut kami yang sedang menikmati hidangan makan siang.

Adapun tempat, kami tidak sempat ke tempat rekreasi yang banyak, namun setidaknya banyak tempat-tempat bagus yang bisa difoto di sini. Sangat enak. Hanya saja, waktu yang terbatas membuat kami kurang menikmati perjalanan dan rekreasi di sini.

Go on a weekday a little quieter. On long lines we took on an average about 10 minutes waiting time.

I would take some nibbles because food is very expensive but that was expected because it is a themed park, it didn’t surprise us.

I do not recommend purchasing tickets to USS at the airport! We did and they were not valid. It was super stressful to get them validated. I had to contact the airport store, because the staff at the USS kiosk couldn't help me.
We took a taxi from the airport to Vivo City mall and it cost about $30. 
On the 4th floor of the mall are ticket machines for the Sentosa express monorail. $4 a ticket. You can walk to Sentosa Island, but it is hot and quite a long walk. 
When you get outside of Universal studios to the right of the 'Iconic World Globe' are self service baggage lockers. $25 will get you a large locker for the day, that can easily fit 2 hand carry suitcases and a handbag- Take a phone photo of your locker number. There are certain rides where you have to store your loose items and they have lockers close to the ride entrances that cost about $10 for a limited time.
The 'express ticket upgrade', is worth it. It doesn't cover every single ride, but most of the main ones. This ensured that we got to go on every ride in about 3 hours. 
Before you go on the Jurassic Park rapid adventure ride. Consider that you might get fully wet and whether that will be a problem during your stop over. Head to the gift shop close to the ride entrance. They sell rain ponchos for $5 that are USS branded and can become a great souvenir to take home. Remove your shoes if you can help it because they will get wet.
Food is quite costly, but that's the case at every theme park I have visited. Certain stores had vegetarian choices which is awesome. 
Things to consider for your stop over- 
It is hot. I was drip sweating, just standing in line to enter.
You are walking a lot. Lets face it, it's already exercise walking Singapore Airport. The USS layout, are rides around a central lake, so there is a lot of walking to get around to every ride.

At the entrance of the universal studio, you will get brochure... explains about the map of the different city, shows timings etc. So first go through it, plan out the things you like and want to do as per your choice. Many shows are happens only for 2 times in a day. 

If you are ride lovers then better to take express pass so can go directly without waiting your time in precious queue. There will be very less queue for single. If you go in single line then your turn will be in 5-10 minutes instead of  40-60 mnt queue.

Pros
- So clean, seriously never been to a big park that was this clean
- Lay out pretty easy, the map can help but we didn't need it, pretty easy to get around 
- Express pass worth every penny, we didn't want all day and had front seat for the majority of rides
- Food, drinks and souvenirs actually affordable 
-3d virtual rides were fantastic,  we both loved Transformers and Shrek,  worth going on!
- Puss n Boots was his favorite,  so much going besides a ride, he loved the story telling 

Cons
- Great the unlimited express pass as the one time only becomes a problem if your child doesn't meet height requirements. They should just go to a different system like if there are 10 rides, give us a card with 10 circles that get marked off.

1,637852593,2018-12-06,MOBILE,5,"It's my first thanksgiving holiday and Singapore was the first place came to mind. My friends and I wanted to spend it somewhere we can really enjoy. 
In Universal Studios Singapore you have to be a child and feel like a child to enjoy. We tried all the rides there is. Since we are early   the lines are not yet too long so be sure to go as early as 9:30 since it opens at 10 am and closes at 6pm. I'm not sure why they close early this season. 
We went directly to Transformers: The Ride because this is the most famous attraction and typically you will wait more than an hour so we don't really want to pass this one out. Other rides like the Battleship galactica Human vs Cylon are really fun to ride. Waiting time was about 30mins. It's good that they put up a sign on how long you might be waiting in line. 
Some of our friends don't really enjoy extreme rides, so since its only the two of us who wanted to try all of them we ask the attendants for single rider pass. It gets you to skip the loooong line but the catch is that you are not going to be with your friend. Anyway it's fine you'll get to know a new one on each ride. And if your lucky, you may just find your soulmate.  just kidding. But yeah, try the single entry pass this way you may try all the rides without waiting. I hate waiting. 
For each ride, you just have to approach the attendants on each ride and there are some where there is a special line designated to single entries. 
By the way, there is a downside, it rained around 4pm and we stayed at the treasure hunt ride, when the rain stopped it took us 30mins and still they didn't restart the ride. They are not allowing people to enter as well but they just let us wait there in vain. They were not even testing the machine and not even telling us that they will not open again. It really pissed me off. They should have told earlier that they would no longer open so we would not have spend another 30mins just to wait for them to operate. I really hate waiting especially if its in vain!

That was it. Weather is unpredictable so remember to bring an umbrella.

- Spend at least  the whole day or two days, if you really wish to enjoy all rides without getting a sense of repetition. 
- Buy the tickets beforehand and express pass, if you wish to avoid queues.
- Don't carry huge bags as you will have to deposit them in lockers at many rides.
- Arrive by 9 am or a little before.
- Take the rides in no particular sequence, depending upon the wait time which is displayed outside each area. 
- You may wish to take the Human-Cylon and Revenge of the Mummy rides on a relatively empty stomach.
- Intersperse rides with the 4D shows to maintain the novelty of each ride - the one of a tornado in New York you shouldn't miss. The live show in the water world is a must see if you enjoy stunts and lots of water.
- Carry a poncho or a change of your top/tee as you will get wet in the Jurassic park ride.

1) Choose weekdays so it will be less crowed and you can avoid express pass expensive ticket.
2) Carry water bottle with you... it's hot outside and water inside is costly (it goes upto 6$ in some counter) but they have many water points same like airport wherein you can refill your bottle... (*** Tap water safe in Singapore)
3) Start in opposite direction... most tour guide inform you not to miss transformer... roller coaster ride and these come on the way when you enter and during start of day its big queue, instead if you start from behind there is less or no crowd on ride.
4) You have option to go out (Don't forget to carry your ticket) of park by putting stamp on your hand. So go out have lunch outside compare to less crowed and less costly food counter and comeback fast for next ride.

- if it isn't long queue, dont waste of used up your 1 time express pass
- the park entry time is from 9am-7pm, there should be enough time to take a 30mins queue ride.

- we took consecutive 3 rounds of transformer ride at 6:35pm (until i almost threw up) as there were less than 10 peeps queuing.
- I took 2pm lunch break inside USS, & dinner at 8pm at outside USS after firework, it cost like $10-15/portion with kinda large at the Asian Cuisine area.

We waited in line. There were long lines. But, when it was time to open, the lines moved fairly quickly. They didn't need passports, they just scanned the barcodes and let us through.
We went to Guest Services to the left of the entrance and arranged our Ultimate Express Pass. We were given a wrist band to wear which made things easy for us.  They didn't ask to see any ID- just scanned the barcode of the Express ticket.
I had written down which rides to do first and what to see, but, my teenager wanted to circle the park in order, so my plans went out the window. Don't listen to your teenager if you don't have the Ultimate Express Pass!!
We got on to most rides without a wait. it was wonderful!!
The lines could be very very long but because of the pass we would go to the head of a separate line and be incorporated into the lines, so you may only have a very short wait or none at all.
There were a couple of rides we couldn't use the pass for and the was the Canopy Flyer- we ended up having to wait about 20 minutes and we hated it. It was a fun flight - I would have liked to do that one a few times. Also the Treasure Hunt one for kids. We didn't manage to do that one.
We loved the transformers ride, the Jurassic Park ride( did that 4 times)  We had to pay for lockers for that ride $4 for 1 hour as we had backpacks, etc.  We had a poncho which came in handy to keep shoes dry, as I forgot to change into thongs ( your feet usually get wet)  
Shrek 4D was a must see. Really enjoyable. 
Loved the Battle star Galactica roller coaster-screamed so much because I was really frightened. My teenager thought it was fun and laughed as I screamed.

Wear good walking shoes. Bring thongs for the Jurassic Park Rapids ride if you are wearing shoes that you don't want to get wet.  Some lockers for rides were free (not Jurassic Park, though) for a certain amount of time depending on how long the wait was for a ride.

It is extremely clean, the staff are informative and polite, the attractions are plentiful and I haven’t had as much fun as I did that day, in years! 
Personal favourite rides were;
1: Transformers
2: The Mummy 
3: Puss In Boots
4: Canopy flyer / Jurassic Park Section of the Park 

Tips for when visiting the park:

1: If you can, don’t visit in school holidays as there was already really long rides and we missed out on going on the two large roller coasters due to waiting times 
2: Buy the express pass, no matter the season.. we would have been able to see the shows and go on all the rides, if we just bought the pass 
3: Some rides you will have to put your belongings in the lockers so try and either visit these rides first or buy stuff towards the end of the day.. as if you go crazy as the gift shops like what we did, you won’t have room to put your bag and gift shop bags in 
4: If it’s raining wear comfortable thongs / waterproof shoes, unless you are comfortable running around the park all day with wet feet. I wore thongs, but my partner wore sneakers and had blisters and wet feet all day.

We we're so excited to see if it will meet our expectation like the Disneyland HK. Before that, just a piece of advice when using booking.com. We thought there'll be no hassle moment for us in purchasing Universal Studio tickets because when we booked our hotel choice thru booking.com, the website emailed us a confirmation that we successfully booked our hotel online and that a QRcode is included as our VIP pass for the 63 SG attractions we'd like to visit and they will just process the payments using our credit card being used in our hotel transaction. Sad to say, at the ticket booth in the Universal Studio, I was showing them the QR code from booking.com and said I will use it. But the officer said they are Not Partners so they didn't accept it.:( Good thing I have SG dollars with me to purchase a ticket. Anyway, what I really want to tackle based on our experience and personal opinion (and when you travel with your kids)is that Disneyland is better than Universal Studios. Why? Because Disneyland offers more enjoyable rides for kids plus a beautiful parade in the afternoon and a magnificent parade in the evening plus the astounding fireworks! In the Universal Studios there's no parade especially when it rains. And when it rains, they cancel rides operations for the safety of people. So better check the weather before going there. But what we like is the transformer ride, lights camera action, and the live concert of donkey. It's good also to dine at Goldilocks inside the theme park because they offer kiddie meal with free souvenir. :)",First Impression lasts,2018-10-01,FAMILY,Happiness23159191431,"Batangas Province, Philippines",Batangas Province,Philippines,1

1 Get a online map of USS  before you even land up in Singapore and decide on what all are the must do rides 
2. If you want to experience all the events and attractions at the place in 1 day , get an express pass - Its worth it , will save a tonne of time
3. If you have small children travelling with you, there are some rides where they are not allowed (think its below 1.3 Mtrs) , so plan accordingly
4. They display the wait time for most rides , if its more than 40 mins , dont wait , finish other things and try again. We landed there and headed straight for the transformers show , waited for 1.45 hrs , in the afternoon the wait time was more like 30 mins .The show was though really good
5. Don`t waste time and money on Caricature , tattoos and photo artists , very expensive and not worth it, you could do this elsewhere too

We got in reasonably early at 1030 and the queues for the rides were already in excess of 60 mins. For a location that is only open for 8 hours that is giving you a maximum of 8 rides for your visit. It only got worse we opted for the Transformers ride which was showing a 70 min wait...at least you’re warned only problem was we queued for over 2hrs for a ride that goes for 4 mins. Ride was a good experience but not worth the wait. By the time we finished the ride the average published queue times on the other rides was 90mins. 

You can purchase a priority queue ticket for $40 SGD once inside Universal Studios which allows you to at least half your queue time. I would suggest this is the only way to potentially get the most out of your day otherwise you will spend your entire day in queues.

As expected for a theme park the food prices where on the very high end. $20 SGD for a average burger, chips and drink.

On the positive the Waterworld action show is worth going to. The actors & actress are entertaining and the plane at the end is the highlight!

Wait times were reasonable at only 10-15 minutes per ride. 
We hired a double stroller on entry for $20, which was invaluable considering that it is a large park and little legs tend to get sore with all of the walking required.
For families with young children it is best to turn left after entering the first section as the rides that cater for younger children are located in that direction. 
Our girls loved the rides. My 4 year old loved the Shrek 4D show and live shows, and my 2 year old loved meeting the different characters around the park. They also loved seeing Donkey Live!, where two children are picked out of the audience to talk to Donkey from Shrek. We sat in the middle of the first long row, and our 4 year old was one of the two children chosen, which was a lot of fun. 
There are of course height restrictions for different rides, and if like us you have a tall child (over 94cm) and under 4 years of age, they will get in free and get to enjoy a lot of the rides.

The price of the ticket may be pricey but it what you can expect from a theme park. I recommend to purchase the ticket online, for saving but skip the normal queue. The theme park split in 7 section with different amazing theme environment. Some ride could be a long wait, however the Mummy and Transformer ride will be more for worth waiting for. The Mummy ride you cannot bring in your bag, so you have to store it in a locker. There a free locker hire in the Mummy section but it free for only a certain amount of time (Can't remember). I highly recommend to get the Express Pass so go in a much shorter line, it may be pricey but it depend how much do you value your time waiting.

A good tip from me, I know waiting for the popular ride, may take up to 90min, it hot and frustrating. But my tip was to come back to for the ride later in the afternoon as it will die out and everyone leaving from a long day and I end up only waiting for 5min to get on.

Queues can get long (even on non-peak days) around 30-60min waits so I suggest heading for popular rides first like Transformers, Battle Star Galactica and the Mummy. Note that Jurassic Park doesn't open until 11am. 

There are some really decent rides at the park. Transformers and Jurassic Park river rapids were great and the Cylon rollercoaster such a thrill. The more kid-freindly areas of Far Far Away, Madagascar and Sesame St were also really fun (loved the nostalgic Seasame Street ride and Shrek 4D always a pleasure). 

I only ate at some of the food carts rather than restaurants/counter service, but what I had was good and good value too. There are good shops too and each have certain merch you won't find in others or the main store, so worth going into all. 

There are lockers available for use, which some rides force you to use. Battlestar Galactica ones are free for a certain period of time but others cost around $4 for 1hr or $20 for the day.

We opted for the fast passes- definitely do that as the lines for some rides were pretty long and we had a 5/6 year old. It's not just the waiting time but the heat and humidity combined that made it hard to line up. So definitely splurge on the fast passes.
We chose to start our time going to the 'left' side of the park when you get through the entrance. I think the first ride was a Madagascar ride. It was a great warm up. We have a small sized child so it was good to take her on rides for her size straight away.  The food was not great- and pricy- amusement park food, but I was not expecting much in the way of food to be honest anyway. The park got crowded during the afternoon. I think we left around 3.

First of all, I was disappointed with the price because as soon as I went in and walked around for 10 minutes, I had nothing to do and the price was quite expensive. Second of all, there were only a few rides that were mostly like roller coasters but there were no other rides except for few roller coasters. All there was a few shops of souvenirs--which were expensive and easy to break.

There were some things that were really cute souvenirs to just look around. There was not much to do but I was strolling around the place, just to see if there is anything else and I had fun exercising. 

So I was really disappointed with how the quality and thought it was unworthy to give that much money to really go in the Universal Studios.

There are approx 5 attractions that I would say adults really enjoy, the battlestar galactica rollercoasters, the mummy, jurassic park rapids and the transformers simulator. The problem is that half of those are external so if it rains they'll close until its safe to operate. So if its a group of adults only, maybe triple check the weather cos you'll miss the best part if it starts raining. 

It would be a lot better though if they didnt charge you for the lockers (45min for free and then you need to pay to reopen them). I mean...if they dont allow you to bring anything (which is logic of course) you should have a safe place for your stuff, period. Specially on the battlestar rollercoasters you're not even allowed to have anything in your pockets..not even if they have zippers, which we were surprised. There's no sign warning about that so you had to start queuing just to have the guy stop you at the entrance and send you back to the lockers, not very friendly I'd say. And then you see people in the queue with hats and little stuff that they were allowed to leave on little shelfs before boarding thte game so...????

Waterworld show is cool, worth paying a visit. 

Crowd control also not very good, we saw people cutting the line to bring in more of their friends, lying their *** off and they were allowed to go in with zero control. 

The other bad aspect is that the opening hours are short, opens at 10 and closes at 6 so if you think about it you're paying almost 10 singapore dollars to be there...when you can easily have lines of 1 hour for the main games, not a lot of time really.","Fun, a few bits to improve though",2018-10-01,COUPLES,naf,"Buenos Aires, Argentina",Buenos Aires,Argentina,0

But Universal studio gets very crowded a lot of times. It has 5 main rides (  Transformer Ride, Mummy ride , Jurrasic Park ride , shrek ride, and Battlestar gallactica roller coaster ride ) along with a Lot of smaller rides. When crowded with normal tickets the wait time usually is 50-60 minutes each ride (or more than that for the transformer ride ). So you can buy another set of express pass tickets inside the park anywhere. The pricing of this express pass tickets is dynamic and depends upon crowd. The day we went it was $40 per sperson. We ended up  buying 3 express pass tickets since if we waited in queue for each ride we would not be able to see all the sections in the park. With express pass you get to enjoy each ride one time along with your family and wait time is not more than 5 minutes. So in my opinion it is worth it.  Out of all rides I really liked Transformer ride and mummy ride. Both of those are in not be missed category. Mummy ride is difficult for senior citizens so proceed with caution.  Jurassic park ride is sort of ok. Also you really do not need a poncho for this ride. even if you get wet it is only until knees most of time and it dries off very quickly in Singapore weather. So do not waste money on buying poncho. For mummy ride and Jurrasic park ride you will need to keep your stuff in lockers provided outside the rides. The lockers work based on your finger print and locker for Mummy ride is free while for Jurassic park there is a charge . when I went there Shrek ride was closed so we ended up doing transformer ride twice with xpress pass. I gave the roller coaster a skip since it was too topsy turvy for me. The other shows not be missed are Speilberg’s Studio show and the waterworld show . Both are really good.

Attractions: 

Day time Universal studios: The props and attractions are great for taking photos and having a great time for literally anyone babies under the age of 2 generally can only get photos taken with mascots and maybe 1-2 rides like the carousel ride and maybe the indoor shows .

Halloween horror night : the attractions are generally fun but this time of year the Halloween theme is a Plus as it is really thrilling and exciting but the ques are mad. Purchasing the Express passes have to be done carefully as it is an add on item and does not include the ticketing price i guess so it dose not look crazy expensive online .... so please do be careful when purchasing them separately.

Service and staff: Staff are all cheerful and polite and who know how to respect others and show initiative in helping those in need e.g assisting parents with prams to the correct lanes and ques . 
However their crowd control is not very effective especially at the street shows where a whole crowd of people watching the show go oblivious and end up blocking the whole walkway .

The availability of different types of food made it easy for us to decide as we were spoiled for choice more so as I am vegetarian. The food in general was well cooked , delicious and fairly priced. We then continued our walk around the attractions. To be honest the longest queues seemed to be for the family attractions 30-40 minutes whereas the white knuckle rollercoasters took between 20 -70 minutes depending on popularity.

Can imagine what it would have been like during school/ public holidays. Found the ticketing system of paying for premium access and thus the ability to cut queues and thus making standard lines longer, annoying and rather discriminatory. Recommend visiting on off peak weekday and go early like 10am when it opens. Access by public transport MRT/ monorail was fairly easy (we stayed on Orchard Road).

8,621329447,2018-10-02,OTHER,2,"Located at the Waterfront station in Sentosa, Universal Studios is an attraction park mostly suited for children. The Battlestar Galactica Cylon rollercoaster is cool (while the Human side is boring) and Revenge of the Mummy is not bad, but these two rides are pretty all the park has to offer for thrill-seekers.

Transformers: The Ride is ""that usual"" 3D ride with moving and shaking seats. Well implemented, but made everyone in our group very motion sick and not wanting to ride it more than once. Pretty much all the other rides are for kids, although some may like doing Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure (identical to every other water ride in major attraction parks) or the special effects demo Lights, Camera, Action! once.

The problems we had with this attraction park are numerous. First of all, the queues and their money-making Express Passes to skip them. People should not be made to pay outrageous prices, just because their park cannot handle the load. Taking a 3 minute coaster ride would require you to line up for 90-120 minutes (although the digital display at entrance said 20 or 30 minutes), as people would just keep on coming in with Express Passes, past everyone who had waited for over an hour in queue. It was easy to see and hear how disgruntled and annoyed people started to become about this money making scheme.

Second problem is the limited free ""rental time"" of the lockers. Certain rides like the Cylon roller coaster require you to leave all your belongings to a locker operated with a fingerprint reader. The idea is sound, but due to long queues, this 30-45 minute free ""rental time"" will expire and then you have a problem: the locker requires you to pay S$4 but all your money is inside the locker. After all, you were not allowed to carry anything with you to the ride. Fortunately, we had a nice gentleman helping us with this. But it's just another thing to add to the already stressful day with overcrowding and overlong queues.

Onto the third problem: the park closes already at 18:00. This means if you're entering at the opening time 10:00, you have a very short time window of 8 hours, which is simply not enough to do much in there. Not with these queues. Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure was shutting down for nearly 2 hours due to thunderstorm during our visit. Add this to the fact that some waiting times were displayed wrong (or Express Pass people let in instead) and we didn't have time to see a some parts of the park in that 8 hour time. At all.

Lastly, the admission fee is extremely high and the park is smaller than its American counterparts. Unfortunately, with all problems considered, we didn't have a very ""fun"" day at all.","Expensive, stressful day",2018-09-01,COUPLES,constanttraveler2014,"Lammi, Finland",Lammi,Finland,-1

The longest wait was for the Jurassic Park boat ride (more than 40 minutes wait) so it might be a good idea to go early and go straight to this one. If you're going to go on the ride, be prepared to get wet - good idea to bring along a pair of slippers. 

The enchanted flight, canopy flyer and Transformers were also nice rides which are suitable for children above certain height. Food was OK at the Discovery food court at Jurassic World. 

Having been to USS several times, I think the service is getting worse. Park rangers were not very friendly and there is minimal interaction between the staff and the visitors as compared to other theme park staff overseas.

So many rides and things to do - won't be cheap but the memories will live on.
Would recommend looking at buying express passes to avoid the queues where possible as we probably wasted a couple of hours lining up for the more popular rides.
Also be careful of the advertised waiting times for some rides as our experience suggested they can't always be relied upon which caused some minor frustrations.
Overall it was a great day and one we will remember for a long time.

2,620695526,2018-09-30,MOBILE,5,"Universal Studios review (Sunday)

So today we headed there at 10am. Not too crowded given it was a Sunday.

COST: $600 for 4 (2A 2C) Incl express passes

EXPRESS PASSES: Before going we weighed up whether to get Express passes. We opted for unlimited which was $70 per person online. This is about the average price as they can range up to $130! I have to say they are 100% worth their weight in gold. We were never lined up for more than 5 min. The rides had waits up to  an hour. We managed to do the whole park and several of the rides 2-3 times. I would do the express pass everytime.

FOOD AND DRINK: expensive as! $3 softdrinks $6 slushies $8 coffees $6.50 mineral water.  We used the water fountains with our own drink bottles from home. Only downside was the water was warm. Lunch was at a chicken burger place $60 for 3 chicken burger meals and a kid's nugget meal. Food was pretty good. We decided to eat there to save time rather than go outside the park. 

RIDES: Awesome. We really enjoyed them.  It was my husband's first ever rollercoaster and both his kids. The kids went on it all except the Battlestar roller coaster. My husband and I did cyclon twice but that finished me off and we didnt make it to the other one called human. 

CROWDS: pretty good considering it was a weekend.  Better than I expected but express passes were still worth it. The crowds move fast in and out of shows and its very well organised. 

WATERWORLD SHOW: Dont miss it. Excellent show and you should sit in first couple of rows!

All up we were there from 10 to 6 which was closing time and we had a ball. Highly recommend going!",Loved it,2018-09-01,FAMILY,Wanderlust_Tarrants,"Mount Gambier, Australia",Mount Gambier,Australia,1
3,620623398,2018-09-30,OTHER,5,"Universal Studios in Singapore was so much fun, that I am going to break it down into individual blog posts.
Universal Studios in Singapore is not large by other park comparisons, but it has been designed in a spacious way, so that it never appears too crowded. The various lands in Universal Studios all flow seamlessly around a central path, that runs in a circular fashion around the entire park, making it impossible to ever be truly lost.
My son and I both love theme parks, for different reasons. He loves all the death defying rollercoasters and rides, whereas I adore all the theming and props. At Universal Studios Singapore, they managed to get both aspects right.
We purchased tickets to Universal Studios on the website Klook, and basically managed to get a two day pass for the price of a single day, which was great as it meant there was no real hurry to fit everything in. The park opens at 10am daily, but the closing time varies so make sure to check the posting on the board as you enter.
We spent almost 6 hours here on each day, and managed to do everything on each day, several times. This will be different for each family obviously, depending upon if you rush through, or have toddlers and so on.
The wait times were really good, up until lunch time, most rides were a 5 minute wait. Transformers was up to a 60 min wait by 11am, Jurassic Park Rapids was up to 70 mins by 1pm, and the Cylon and Human Battlestar Galactica lines were at 115 mins by 11:30am, so if you intend to do these, plan accordingly.
Universal Studios offers a priority queue system, which costs $50 per person, for a single ride on each of the attractions offering priority. For $70 per person, you can get unlimited rides on each attraction offering priority. We did not get this, and even at peak periods, my son never waited longer than  20 mins. His secret? Go into the single rider line, every ride at Universal Studios has one, and as long as you don’t mind not going together, you can significantly cut your waiting times down.
We were really glad that we had a two day pass, and enjoyed every minute of both days. We liked all the rides and attractions, and it was fun to see all the adults lining up for the Sesame Street Spaghetti Space Race, I even heard one mum saying to her daughter who looked to be around eleven, “oh please come with me, I’ll pay you fifty bucks”! Even I queued for Oscar the Grouch, which was totally worth it!

We bought our tickets on the day (S$76)but I understand you can make a slight saving in advance. Far Far Away Land and Madagascar were awesome and different to the other Universal parks. Queues were stating much longer than what we waited so take waiting times with a pinch of salt. Cyclon at Galactica said 75 but we waited max 20!

My boyfriend is 6’8” so were concerned about his height. The only problem he had was on the roller coaster in Far Far Away land but had no issues on the bigger rides.

2,620006246,2018-09-27,MOBILE,4,"Universal Studios is a name most people know and U.S. Singapore lives up to the standards of its counterparts in Osaka and in Los Angeles. I went on a weekday and it wasn’t as busy as I expected and was pleasantly surprised when I waited between 5minutes -1hour for the attractions.  

One helpful thing to know is that on the big Coasters- namely Cyclo and Battlestar Galactica: Human- you need to put your bags, phones, wallets, hats, sunglasses etc in a locker. The attraction staff use a metal detector wand and if they find anything they will ask you to empty evening the locker. There was no fee for the locker- you just need to either at the locker kiosk do a fingerprint if or put in a secret pin to unlock the locker. I tried the fingerprint and it was painful and did not always recognise my print, so I then just used a secret pin.

Also, if you are planning to ride the Rapture Rapids- you have to rent a locker- but get this they are not free, the cheapest, for 1hour was S$4- I thought this was a bit of a rip off so I  left it. The ride operators show photos of how wet you will get, so if you did bring your belongings they would indeed be drenched. 

I also stayed for the Halloween Horror Night 8- I was brilliant! After the general public left at 6, I showed the staff near Mel’s diner my ticket and waited at the diner until 7pm where those of us up for a scare sat and were then collected and taken to the main stage to see an opening show, then we were asked to run! We fled the main stage for the Haunted Houses. 

The park stays open until 1am and they have 5 Haunted Houses available to spook you! I really enjoyed The Stranger Things inspired haunt and the Pagoda of Peril- the attention to detail was fantastic. There is an additional fee for this after park scare-a-thon but it is worth it in my opinion. 

To get to Universal Studios you first need to take the MRT to Harbourfront station, then you can take the monorail, a bus or cable car to Sentosa Island. I took the monorail that was S$4 for a return ticket.",Indulgent fun!,2018-09-01,SOLO,Scott H,"Melbourne, Australia",Melbourne,Australia,1
2,619943860,2018-09-27,OTHER,5,"Ok, I started writing this review a few weeks back. We were in Singas catching up with family when we went. It was our first time and we loved it. We had bought the Express pass(one shot at specified rides) and luckily we had. We were unaware that it was the first day of school holidays. It was busy! We queued for a couple rides and it was a long wait. Popular rides: The Jurassic Park water one, Dino Flyer, Transformers and Cylon seem to be the ones with the biggest queues. At the end of that day, my family of 4 bought a 6 month pass (we were going back to Singas in 2 weeks).
Oh my goodness. I am so glad we did. 

This time, as a a little family of 4 with no express passes was different. The first day was a Monday - arrived for half 10 and it was busy already. It was also the day after the Grand Prix so that might have been why too. We found that their queue times were never accurate. Could say 20 mins and we would be in line for an hour - or say 5 minutes and be straight on. My youngest and I almost lost the will to live when lining up for the Transformers ride. We knew we were coming back the day after, so we were ok with the limitations of no express pass. In saying that, I think my husband was ready to poke his eye out for the massive queue he waited in for the Jurassic Water ride. It was loonnnggg!
On our 2nd day (Tuesday) it was quiet. We were there for opening. We dashed to Transformers, no queue. Sent the tall enough daughter and husband to smash out the Mummy, Cylon (three times) and Human rides (all done within the 1st hour). The not so tall daughter and I enjoyed Seasme street, Madagascar and a carousel (her legs are a little slower hahah). We met all the guys we wanted, saw the Water Show, did the Donkey Show and not once did it feel like we waited for a ride. I will be honest - we didn't go near the Jurassic Water one (by the way Jurassic World opens at 11).
Some people are pushy and don't care if there is a little person waiting in front of them - but that seems to be at any theme park. Didn't dampen the kid's day. Food is expensive but a) you are in a theme park b) the theme park is in Singas.
All the workers, performers, everyone were great. It was set up for Halloween - geez I wish we could see that - looks awesome. 
When visiting keep in mind afternoon thunder storms are common. Make sure you smash out your must do activities by 2 to be sure!

My husband being a big fan of rollercoasters decided it was something we needed to do. We went on a Friday which was busy, I don’t think I would have liked to go at the weekend. We took a 15 minute taxi to get there, wanting to arrive just as it opened. There queue to buy tickets wasn’t long and we opted for just the full day pass, they do offer an unlimited express pass, so you can skip the queues as many times as you want on most rides (think it omits 4 rides), it was pricey so decided against it at this time. We went on one ride with a 20minute wait time and hubby decided that was to long so we went back and bought the unlimited express pass. So worth it, most rides from 10.30am onwards had a queue time of 60minutes+!! There aren’t many “big” rides but there is still plenty to do, if you have kids I think it would be good as there is a lot for children. We caught the Waterworld show as well which was good. Most of the rides don’t allow you on with your belongings so will make you put them in lockers, you don’t need to pay for these, just don’t forget your locker number like we did and have a mini panic that you may never get your stuff back.

Best to go there early. Park opens at 10am, but be there at around 9 so that you can take a picture at the globe before it gets too crowded. 
Cover major attractions early in the day before queues get too long. Specially since you need to store your items at lockers for some attractions and these lockers are free only up to 45mins, being early could save you few bugs as well. 
Must try items are 2 battle star galactic roller coasters , transformers ride, revenge of the mummy, lost world rapid adventure, shrek 4D show and the water world show. 

Do some research before going there and plan your day so that you won’t waste the time there waiting in queues. 

You can take the sentosa express and get down at waterfront station or just walk through sentosa broadwalk while enjoying the views across the ocean.

Мы добирались по пешеходному мосту (время 15 мин). 

Один билет стоит около 75 сингапурских долларов - все аттракционы бесплатно. 
В стоимость билета также включен ваучер на 5 долларов на еду.

Все пишут о больших очередях, но нам повезло и самое большое стояли в очереди час.

Из всех аттракционов точно стоит посетить взрослым:
- трансформеры
- древний египет
- американские горки (идите на Cylon (мега крутые), а не на Human)

Также обязательно посетите представление Водный мир (по мотивам фильма). Обратите внимание, что чем дальше вы сядете - тем суше будете. Мы сели в самом начале и вышли все сырые. 

В целом, мы пришли к 12 часам в парк. Очередей на билеты на было. Гуляли, фотографировались, смотрели сувениры и катались на горках. Все это до 6:30 вечера где-то (вроде в 6 вечера прекращают работать аттракционы и парк по-тихоньку закрывается).
Потом еще погуляли и отправились на набережную сентозы чтобы посмотреть Танец Журавлей (тоже бесплатно) - очень красиво. 

Express pass не брали (еще плюс 50 сингапурских долларов к каждому билету).
Но это, конечно, значительно упростило бы. Если брать - то точно анлимитед (проход на все аттракционы вне очереди), а не единичный (проход вне очереди на один аттракцион).

Таким образом, целый день провели в парке)

Tips:

1) Express Pass - if you buy this online ahead of time, will only cost $30 per person and allows you to skip the queue once each ride. This was defintely worth it, saving HOURS in waiting. We went on a non-holiday Monday and even then, queses for Human/Cylon were up to 80min. The pass can also be purchased in-park, but price increases with demand. Even on our quiet Monday, the price shot up to $50.

2) Bring lots of water! You can get same day return stamps that allows you to leave USS and sample the food in Resorts World in between. This is a better option than the typical overpriced mediocre food within the theme park.

3) Free lockers (up to 45min) are provided to store bags at rides that need it. The exception being the Jurassic Park ride where you should expect to get drenched (depending on your luck). Some people bring ponchos, but most clothes will dry off quickly in the searing heat of Singapore anyways.",Express Pass - worth the extra $30,2018-09-01,COUPLES,chubbychimpz,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Auckland Central,New Zealand,1

0,617523650,2018-09-17,OTHER,3,"First of all, the visuals and infrastructure are amazing and the park is worth visiting for this alone.  

Now the downside.  We visited on the 23rd August and it was a hot day and the park was very busy, therefore, the queues were very long.  In hindsight, we should have considered the fast pass although even that was lengthy on most of the rides.  Not sure how much this cost but would recommend checking this first.  Due to the lengthy queues we only managed to try 4 rides and view the Shrek 4D film.  The children enjoyed all of the attractions but only one of them was good for me (Battlestar Galctica) but this required spending money by putting all of our belongings in a locker.  The locker is free for a period of time but as the queue is longer than the free locker time, you end up having to pay anyway!

The other thing that annoyed us was the park closing time of 7pm.  Now I have checked that it does close later on certain days but I have no idea why it closed at 7pm on the day that we visited.  The weather was good, there was good lighting (although I would imagine the park looking really nice at night) so it should have closed at 10pm in my opinion.

Therefore, if visiting, get there when it opens so that you can maximise your day, consider the fast queue pass and try and go on a day that it closes later.

Additionally, the prices for the ride photos were very expensive ($35).  We were advised that it was 2 for the price of 1 but when purchasing it changed to 3 for the price of 2, so we cancelled as we were not sure if we would have enough money for the day.  I attempted to purchase the photos a few days later via email but after being advised that my query was being referred to the photo team I have heard nothing!

The rest of the lines were 45 minutes tops. we got to go on every thrill ride and still ended up leaving around 5pm as we had achieved everything we wanted out of the day and had the walk back.

I picked a weekday and possibly during the school term of Singapore.  Therefore, I hardly needed to queue for each ride.

We travelled in a taxi from our Hotel and arrived right on the opening time of 10am. We then purchased our 1-Day Adult plus One-Use Universal Express tickets from the sales booth on-site. This cost us $106SGD per person. 

We decided to immediately go on as many rides as possible, and straight away we were so glad we purchased the add-on Express tickets. We went on Transformers The Ride, Battlestar Galactica CYLON, Battlestar Galactica HUMAN, Revenge of the Mummy, and Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure all prior to an early lunch! The longest that we waited for any ride was 5mins, and this was quite fantastic.

We ate a lovely lunch of Laksa and a Prawn Noodle Soup in the air-conditioned Food Court. Add in one bottle of water, and lunch was a very reasonable $26SGD. We enjoyed eating a little earlier and beating the crowds.

The Waterworld Stunt Show was great fun!

Then we went on more rides, including Enchanted Airways, Shrek 4D Adventure, and Madagascar: A Crate Adventure.

What a great day out! I recommend that you arrive early, purchase the add-on Express tickets, wear sunscreen, and prioritise what you want to do.

Its best to book from rwsentosa website as express pass is an add-on which could only be bought with tickets online and I havent find any website which provide Express Pass apart from Universal's or Sentosa's official website. Express pass has Dynamic Pricing so it keeps on increasing based on demand and how advance you book it.

1,614699438,2018-09-07,MOBILE,5,"Universal Studio Singapore (USS) is one of the most favourite place to visit in Singapore. It is a great theme park you have to visit when you are in Singapore.

 How to get here?
There are many ways to reach here. But the key is Vivo City Mall as the transit area before crossing to Sentosa Island if you are using public transportation.
The easiest way is using MRT to go to Vivo City.
MRT : choose Harbourfront MRT station as your destination. You will be directly inside Vivo City Mall. 

After arriving to Vivo City, you can choose 4 ways :
1. Sentosa Express : go to the 3rd level, and use your EZ link card to directly entry to the Sentosa Express station. Or you can buy ticket here if you don't have EZ link card/NET. It takes $4/person.
2. Sentosa Boardwalk : find direction to Sentosa Broadwalk (outdoor), and follow the direction. It takes $1/person to entry Sentosa Island.
3. Bus : go to the bus station outside Vivo City, and choosr RWS8 bus
4. Sentosa cable car : It is quite expensive  $35/person and I have no experience

Choose Waterfont station.

 What can be do here?
I was going here with my 2 y.o child. Honestly, this place is not suitable for your under 4 y.o child.. My child can't entry most of the attractions because they really strict about height.. I suggest you to go with your 4 y.o child above to enjoy all the attractions offered..

They have some popular atractions :
-Transformers the ride in Sci Fi City : enjoy a 4D experience fight decepticon
-Battlestar galactica human vs cyclon : outdoor roller coaster 
-Mummy : indoor roller coaster with dark view
-Rapid Adventure in Jurassic Park : rafting in dinosaur park

All of attraction I mention above will have a long queue. If you don't mind to be separated with your group, choose single rider line. Sometimes it works. I accelerate waiting time in Rapid Adventure from 2 hrs to 5 mins only. But it didn't work in Transformers because some people do the same. 
If you want to skip the queue, buy Universal express which take additional cost per person.

☉ When is the best time to go here?
Go in the morning and enjoy the attraction in the whole day

 What is the best outfit?
Wear an outift which comfort you. Casual is the suitable outfit. Don't forget to bring spare clothes as your

 Admission
In the official website, the admission is  
- SGD 76 (13-59 y.o)
- SGD 56 (4-12 y.o)
- SGD 38 (60-above)
- Free for kids under 4 y.o

I recommend you to buy max day-1 your visit to avoid long queue especially in the weekend. There are some provider offering the voucher cheaper than official website.

I suppose in retrospect it was not as busy if it were the weekend, but wait time for Battlestar Galactica ride was 70 minutes and the Transformer's ride was about 40 minutes. It was not fun.

On almost all the rides that we got on, we also noticed that the staff manning the rides were just short tempered. We had an extra 30 minute wait at Transformer's ride due to some technical failure and people were just getting antsy. The staff manning the ride started screaming at people to get back in line.

3,613480637,2018-09-03,OTHER,5,"A day at Universal Studios will leave you tired - very tired. There is just so much to do. I am not giving you the list of sections or rides as thats easily available online. What I am going to tell you though is what all you can do with a 3 year old kid. My son even though he didn't know most of the characters or movie references was super excited once he got into Universal Studios. We arrived at about 9:30 am and it took us 10 minutes to get inside.
How you plan your day at Universal is very important because the shows and the character meet and greets happen at a specific time. So you have to list our your must dos and then plan the rest of the rides accordingly. 
Our 3 year old son went on Treasure Hunters, Dino Roaring, Magic Potion Spin, Enchanted Airways, Madagascar Crate Adventure, King Julien Beach Party Go Around and Accelerator. He enjoyed all of them as would most 3 to 5 year olds. The only one you can avoid is the Magic Potion Spin which was rather slow and boring. The Enchanted Airways is a mini roller coaster and we were scared for our kid but he rather enjoyed it. 
We tried to fit in as many shows as possible and ended up seeing Waterworld, Shrek 4D, Madagascar Boogie, Elmo's TV Time, Steven Spielberg Show and the ongoing special Jurassic World Roar. The shows were all ok but nothing great. 
Every child loves real life versions of cartoon characters so we were on time to do the Character Meet and Greets for Madagascar, Elmo, Minions and T Rex. Our son loved the Madagascar cast as they were not only posing for photographs but also interacting properly. There are official cameramen taking your pictures at all these places and if you do decide buying all of them then you will blow up a lot of money. Instead you can just settle for the pictures that the staff take from your phone. 
The only disappointing bit was that our son was refused entry to the Jurassic Park Rapids, Sesame Street Spaghetti Space Club and Dino Training. I can understand if he was refused entry at the entry point itself but at the Sesame Street ride we stood in line for more than 30 minutes - reached the ride entry point only to be denied - this was very annoying especially for a 3 year waiting so long for his turn. 
There are a number of over priced food outlets inside but we were constantly running from one section to another and in general having such a good time that we never felt hungry. The souvenir shops are expensive - an Alex the Lion from Madagascar soft toy cost us 25 SGD. But overall the experience was fabulous.
Lot of people ask about the Express Pass. Yes the waiting times are minimum 10-15 minutes even on kiddy rides and some of the bigger attractions can make you wait for more than 45 minutes but it all depends on the day. Luckily each ride mentions the waiting time at the entry stage so you know what to expect. Also a lot of reviews mention that the lines get shorter in the afternoon but we felt they were just about the same all throughout till 6 pm when we finally got tired and left.",Enough Excitement for Even a 3 Year Old,2018-08-01,FAMILY,AbhimanyuSinghi,"Ludhiana, India",Ludhiana,India,1

1) Overwhelming amount of people, approximate waiting time to do 1 adventure was of 120 minutes... and I went on a Monday morning!!!

2) The park organizers sell as many express pass AS THEY CAN, meaning that first of all it is USELESS that you spend 100 SING. $ for a pass; and second that waiting time (even with pass) was of over 60 minutes!

3) We found something like 10 adventures closed because of ""technical problems"". Then they would open again, and then close again... THIS IS RIDICULOUS! And imagine that on one of them we even got trapped for over 30 minutes... good that we don't suffer of claustrofobia, otherwise it would have a real nightmare!

I would strongly suggest to visit only on weekdays for tourists or take a 2 day pass if exists or a fast pass is also worth on weekends. Mostly all parks have fast pass but they are not worth if there are less visitors however for universal fast pass is worth if your budget allows. I visited on a weekend with a 1 day pass so had got a change to sit on each ride only once. i wanted to go to some rides again but did not have the time. if you like fast rides then the mummy ride and the 2 sci fi rides are at its best. the rest are mostly for kids of all ages.,Excellent Theme Park - has rides for adrenaline junkies and toddlers aswel,2018-08-01,FAMILY,Kishan,"Sharjah, United Arab Emirates",Sharjah,United Arab Emirates,1

The waiting time in queues is killing. i remember standing for almost 90 minutes with my 7 year old for the Mummy roller coaster.

What else would we accomplish if we stay in line for the lines??? we waited for our almost 2 hours in line at the Transformers attraction for a 2-3 minute ride? OMG!!! waiting time for the explorers was 45 minutes! my kids would not wait for that long! ive been to Disneyland Anaheim and Hong Kong Disneyland but the queues were not these long! they even had fast pass! wherein in USS, you need to pay a lot for Express tickets, which would also take you more than 20mintues waiting time! I don't think its worth it! My kids were already so tired from all the waiting and we only rode 4 attractions!!!! the amount we paid for 6 people were not worth it! i regret putting this in our itinerary just because USS is a main attraction in SG! I would have been glad to pay dollars if I was guaranteed that we could ride even half of the attractions! My only consolation was the Waterworld show because a lot could fit it in the area. And my children went to seat in the soak/blue zone and they loved it! So if you like to wait in line for minimum of 1 hour  per ride, go ahead, and buy tickets. but im telling you, its not worth waiting under the scorching sun or even inside the attraction as there are a lot of smells and not so friendly visitors also trying to shove and push you and your children, without being sorry even! so boooooo! i don't like the USS!",too crowded!!,2018-08-01,FAMILY,Jamie Z,"Pangasinan Province, Philippines",Pangasinan Province,Philippines,-1

We were also quite surprised with the demeanour of certain park-staffs who raised their voice at little children for running into lines. The scene was shocking enough for adults like us, what more for little children.

However, the worst part of the experience is the amount of time you have to wait in queues to take the rides. For an example: even though we went on a weekday, we had to stand in queue for hour and a half each for ‘Mummy’ and ‘Transformers’, which are propovably two of the four or five  decent rides they have. In contrast, there are hardly any wait times in IMG in Dubai, which is an indoor theme park and some of the rides are better.

At once around 30riders can ride and ride time is around 3Mins. So my advice is most crowded and time consuming Que is Transformer cos only 12riders for one ride and takes around 7 to 8mins. If you go early morning rush to Transformers ride then Battlestar Galacticea & Mommy.... With in first 30mins of the park we've finished Mummy & B/G but wait more than 2hours on Transformers. Also Jurrasic park was crowded and waiting time shows 120mins and we skipped that. All other rides are less crowded. Puss in Boots is also interesting. Overall one day is not sufficient to cover everything and hence better prioritize if you are a one day visitor. Some are jumping the que specially in Battlestar Galactica.

4,610712221,2018-08-26,OTHER,5,"As a single visitor, I managed to skip several long lines thanks to single rider queues. (I went alone because a friend gave me a soon-expiring ticket.) Here is my experience in the park. The first 4 rides in my review have single rider queues. The other rides in the park do not. 

Battlestar Galactica: This is the most popular attraction in the park so I went to this ride immediately after the park opened. There are two queues - one for the Human ride, one for the Cyclon ride. As bags and loose items are not allowed, one must deposit everything at the lockers on the left side of the queues. (Lockers are free for 45 minutes. Spectacles and slippers are allowed in the queue but must be kept in the pigeon holes at the platform before departure.) As I was the first few to arrive, I didn't need to queue at all for the Human ride and I only queued 5 minutes for the Cyclon ride. (I found Cyclon more intense than Human as Cyclon has more inverted loops and corkscrews.) Remember to press your head into the headrest to avoid neck pain and dizziness.

Transformers the ride: This is also a highly popular attraction of the park. Although there is a single rider queue, I found that some people abused the queue. (I saw groups of families and even school groups in the single rider queue.) As a result, I waited 20 minutes even though the ride itself is less than 10 minutes long. Unlike the Battlestar Galactica, Transformers allow personal belongings so there's no need to use the lockers. As Transformers is an indoor air-conditioned attraction, it gets popular on hot days and rainy days.

Revenge of the Mummy: This is another highly popular attraction. It is indoors and air-conditioned like Transformers, but it requires riders to deposit bags and personal belongings in the lockers on the left and right sides of the entrance. Unlike Transformers where people abused the single queue, Revenge of the Mummy had very strict staffs which only allowed truly single riders to enter the single queue. As a result, I bypassed the very long normal queue and I experienced zero waiting time! Revenge of the Mummy has a roller-coaster portion and I found the twists and turns quite intense. Remember to press your head into the headrest to avoid neck pain and dizziness.

Canopy Flyer: This is a Jurassic Park themed roller coaster. Like the Revenge of the Mummy, Canopy Flyer had very strict staffs that enforced single riders in the single queue, so I experienced a very short waiting time (less than 5 minutes). After riding Battlestar Galactica, I found the Canopy Flyer rather mild. Because of its mildness, Canopy Flyer has a lower height restriction and hence more children in the normal queue than the previous 3 rides that I mentioned.

Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure: This is also a popular attraction and it has a single rider queue. However, I didn't take this ride because I didn't want to get soaked. 

The other rides do not have single rider queues and I had to queue together with everyone else. There are LED screens around the park indicating the estimated waiting times for the various attractions, so check out the screens and avoid the attractions with long waiting time. Remember to pick up the event schedule near the entrance so that you can catch the various free shows at the specified times.

The food in the park is expensive. For cheaper dining options, you can leave the park, visit the Malaysian food-court or one of the fast food restaurants in Resort World, and re-enter the park within the same day.

3,610398371,2018-08-26,OTHER,5,"My family recently returned to Singapore, to live, and once again bought an annual membership.  During our first 'pass', my daughter was about four years old.  Now, she's eight and a whole new world has opened up.  For about two months now, we have gone to Universal once a week - and we just adore it.  My daughter's two favourite attractions are the Mummy ride and the Rockefellas dance troop.  The Mummy is just a wonderful escape from the heat, in that it's an indoor rollercoaster which is modest in its adrenaline drive.  The Rockefellas are a wonderful group of break / urban dancers who are always enthusiastic, and my daughter is always one of the volunteers to dance during the audience interaction segment - and they are always so kind to her.  A new favorite of my daughter is the Donkey show which is fun and also a great break from the heat.  Of course, the big attractions are the major coasters - Human and Cylon.  With the annual fast pass, we can easily do 8 to 10 rides per half day, so I strongly encourage getting the fast pass.  A lot of the negative reviews lately point to the long lines, and I must say, I wouldn't even try Universal if I didn't have the fast pass - it would be too painful.  Remember, the lines are particularly long during the summer months, so if you can afford it, get the annual pass - or get ready to wait and wait.  For food, I'd suggest you try to hold off until you leave the park since there are many better restaurants in the nearby areas outside.

However, it is located in an excellent part of Singapore and once you are there, you want for nothing. 

The entrance queues were long, but if you patient they go down quickly, with helpful staff on each turnstile. 

**Please Note**
If you booked your tickets online, you will undoubtedly need to visit ‘Guest Services’ first, to collect your tickets. I noticed some people were able to scan their letter at the actual entrance turnstile, however ours would not scan (even though it had a bar code). 

Once inside, there are two queues for the bigger rides. The standard queue was up to 170 minutes, whilst the express queues (additional cost) was on 15-20 minutes, so make your own mind up on whether you wish to pay the extra (I wish we had!!)

If you are a fast roller coaster fan, then realistically there are are only three main rides for you. All three are very good and worth the waiting times!!

Had I taken the normal day ticket, I would have been able to attend maximum 2 to 3 attractions.  Also if you have little children, they will become increasingly impatient and tired.  Second, reach the park latest by 9.30 am.  As they say, early bird catches the worm, you will be able to cover most of the attractions if you start early.  Most of the Singaporeans visit the park from midday and it can get really crowded even for Express lanes at each attraction.

Found it really difficult to find shelter and even indoor rides were backed right out the door. Tickets are really expensive and we wanted to make the most of the day despite weather. We had spare clothes packed so we braved weather only to find loads of rides closed and shows postponed because of the weather. 
Disappointed with wait times as found when express pass people came they weren’t accurate, especially on Shrek 4D ride. Also really disappointing as after waiting double the waiting time that they didn’t fill the cinema once we were inside. 
Jurassic Park and the Lost World turned it around with great ride for all ages we have kids aged 2-6. 
Queues were horrendous during peak hours and some really sweltering (enchanted airways). Our one saving grace is that we stayed till closing and in the final hour we got to ride a couple of rides that had up to 2 hour waiting times during the day. Recommend riding as a single rider if you can however for a family of 5 not always possible. Food and drink expensive and not great quality so recommend bringing your own, loads of 7/11’s on route so stock up. 
Positives were that it feels safe, plenty of buggy storage, lockers and toilets (though some smelt badly - lost world). The park isn’t big so easy to navigate round. I think for the price is not great value, we ended up having a great day despite the bad weather and managed to get on 10 rides/shows in the end (with barely any rest in between and most towards in final hour of closing).

With wait times of between 50 and 160 minutes for all but the baby rides (which still have a wait time of 25 minutes) this place represents one of the worst value for money experiences I have ever had.

1,608526028,2018-08-20,OTHER,3,"So this was rated pretty highly on tripadvisor and is one of the ""must do"" activities when visiting singapore. After visting universal studios in the US I had expectations this would be on a similar scale but it is much smaller and nowhere near as good.

The park seems to mainly be aimed for families and younger kids - There was only 1 large rollercoaster if I remember correctly? Bit dissapointing. For people in the UK I reckon Thorpe Park / Alton Towers have more ""adult"" rides than universal singapore.

The staff and hosts at the park really do work their best to put on a show and welcome guests. In the 40c heat under direct sun they are out there singing, dancing and putting on huge costumes for your amusement. I was hot and bothered just watching them yet they do so all day - props to them.

The layout is a big circle, you cant really miss anything if you go around in a clockwise/anti-clockwise direction which is good. I recommend starting at the back of the park (12 o'clock) to start the day off as everyone crowds the entrance to the park in the mornings! 1 day here is plenty of time to do pretty much everything.

The thing that really ruined our experience of this park has to be the clientelle... I am sorry to say it but tourists from certain locations absolutely ruined the day for us. A huge lack of patience all around - constant pushing, invading of personal space and trying to jump the line. Staff dont seem to care and do nothing to stop this behaviour.

I normally would not complain or say anything as you expect to have long lines at an attraction like this but when you have people literally breathing down your neck, standing on your feet and trying to push past you in a stationary line it drives you nuts. It takes a lot to make a Brit have a go at someone in public instead of quietly accept the situation. (no points for guessing what tourists cause these issues..  translated travel advice is provided for them in every country we visited this holiday lol)

Be prepared to get nickle and dimed here - Singapore is expensive but you will be paying out the nose for food, drinks, entrance just like any other amusement park. Another problem was the lockers, as a couple we had nobody to leave our bags with and they dont allow a single item to be carried onto the rides (apparently not even phones, yet once we got a locker they let other people on with phones and glasses etc...) The locker was free for 20 minutes but the queue increased to 45, so we were stuck with an extortiante fee to enjoy the rides.

If you have done universal in the US I would say dont bother with this as its in a much lower league. For those who have not done universal, give it a shot.

I would recommend bringing some things:
- Umbrella to keep the sun off your head. I had no hat so had to resort to holding a park map over my head all day
- Suncream
- Water and bottles to fill
- Money $$$$$$$$
- Camera
- Some snacks if you dont fancy spending 15$ for a basic burger

Good:
- Good activity for the day with a family / young children
- Very clean park
- Staff work hard to give a good show - Waterworld is great, make sure you see that
- Free WiFi
- Free water fountains (not that common)
- Nice park layout

Bad:
- Other guests ruin the experience
- Bad customer service from online support, had to buy tickets twice
- You have to pay a toll tax to come in via any vehicle, even a taxi
- Super expensive
- Locker concept is a rip off, let me leave my bags near the exit like other theme parks..
- Not enough adult rides
- Wait times not accurate, generally takes 15 minutes longer than shown on the screen
- After spending over $40 on a meal of 2 burgers, chips and 2 soft drinks the staff told me I cant get a bloody refill? It costs less than 5p to make a coke and they were saying I had to pay again.

6,605155493,2018-08-10,OTHER,1,"たまたまなのかわかりませんが、月曜日なのにすごい人でした。そのためエクスプレスパスを購入したのですが、一人110SGD。高すぎ。でもこの日は待ちがものすごかったので、エクスプレスパスは必須でした。

ライド系がほとんどです。なので、ジェットコースターが好きではない人には楽しめる場所がほとんどありません。高校生の娘は入場後１時間程度で「もういい。帰りたい。」と涙目で、結局ずっと座って待ってました。またジェットコースターが好きな私でも、少し旅行の疲労がたまっている状態だとかなりきつく、しかも絶叫系かと言われたら、日本のものと比べるとかなりおとなしめで、ただただ気持ち悪いという、ビミョーなものが多かったです。

あと、待ち時間表示が超いいかげんです。数字は無視してください。なので、どれくらい待つのかは初めて来た人には全く予想つきません。それもあるので、エクスプレスパスにせざるをえないかなというところです。

あとこれは我が家だけの話かもしれませんが、購入したバウチャーは、入り口に向かって右の方にある無人KIOSKでチケットに交換しなければいけないと、購入したVoyaginに聞いていたのですが、機械がとまっていました。しかし、聞いていた時間９時より前だったので、もしかすると９時になったら起動するのかなと思って、他にも数家族並んで待っていました。
しかし、すでにシンガポール３日目でシンガポールの超いいかげんなシステムに慣れてきた我が家は「これはあやしい」と、急いで人をかき分けスタッフに確認したところ、やはり「今日はKIOSKは動いていない。チケットカウンターに並べ」と言われ、あわててチケットカウンターの長蛇の列に並び直し、早く到着したのに結局入場はかなり遅れました。日本人の感覚だと、Webにその案内を掲示しておくとか、その旨の案内表示をおいておくとか、説明の紙をはっておくとか、Voyaginからその旨の連絡があるとか、なんらかのことをしてくれてもいいのにと思いますが、「表示や説明書きは信じるな。ネット情報も一切信じるな。情報は現地で人から直接入手しろ。それがいやならそこでじっと待ってろ。行動しない人に観光する権利はない。」という文化のようなので、ほんの少しでも違和感を感じたら、即座に「複数人」に聞きまくって、その中の大多数の情報を一か八か信用する、という方法をとらないと、日本人にとって当然の権利（例えば今回は、USSに入場するという権利）を行使することが、観光客にはとても難しいようです。
（とても疲れるし、一瞬でも油断するとすぐに損をしてしまいますが、緊張感のないここ数年の旅行スタイルに喝を入れられた気分で、それはそれで異文化を堪能できて、良かったと思います。）

あと、列を守らない民族が多いです。旅行客ですが。少しでもすきがあるとどんどん抜かれます。７人の巨体家族の、小柄なアジア人を押しのけながらのぬきっぷりは流石に目にあまり声をかけたところ、「エクスプレスパスなんだからいいんだ」と、わけのわからないことを言っていました。
なので、「順番守らないことも文化」と考えるのが吉です。（USSに限らず、シンガポール全般の話ですが。）

まとめると、時間が余ったなら行ってもいいと思いますが、わざわざ目的にする場所とは思えませんでした。（日本のTDRやUSJの方がはるかに楽しめます。比較になりません。）",うーん。。。,2018-08-01,FAMILY,shirope0,Japan,,Japan,-1

The park is huge so go early to be able to catch all the attractions! The Battlestar Galactica roller coasters (2 of them) are the best action ride, along with The Mummy roller coaster. That last one is almost in total darkness & is completely indoors which adds to the adrenaline rush!

2,603729145,2018-08-06,OTHER,4,"I am suggesting some tips, which I feel would have helped me had I read these before I visited Universal

1) Lets start with the tickets. if you are a local, then makes sense to buy a 6 monthly season pass online and go there and convert it to a 6 mnthly pass. Takes about 5-10min to do at the guest services counter, as they click your photo and make an ID. cost of the day ticket is approx SGD $70 and cost of the 6 monthly is about 30$ more around 95 odd $ 

2) A day is enough to do most rides, if you are adults and ready to go in the single rider queue. But if you queue at most rides in the normal family/attraction line then its a lot of waiting time, many rides at peak time are about a 45 min wait for each. That according to me is a long boring wait esp as it ends in a 1 min ride most of the times. So single rider is my advise. 

3) Go 15 min before the park opens at 10am. that way you may have less waiting for the first few rides. 

4) The park is much smaller if you compare to the USA one, so go first to the rides you think are a must. Its not much of a walk between the park areas

We decided before time that we would just bit the bullet and pay extra for a Universal Express Unlimited pass for the 4 of us. Bottom line is - best choice ever! We arrived at Universal at around 9.30am and the line for tickets (I had not ordered them earlier because we had a few days on Sentosa and I didnt want to lock into a day without checking the weather first). The queue was short at that time and easy. We lined up in the Express queue to get in at 10am (about 90% shorter than the general attendance line) and went straight into the guest services room to have wrist bands handed to us (so we weren't juggling individual tickets like with the standard Express Pass that gives you express entry just once per ride). We then headed left as everyone else was running to the right which meant we started in Madagascar - if you have young children head in this direction first as it was nearly empty for that first hour. The express unlimited pass meant that if we loved a ride we went straight back on it again. The longest we queued for any ride that day (including the big rollercoasters) was 10 minutes - most often we walked straight on or waited maybe 5 minutes. This is a huge difference when others are waiting for an hour plus. If you have one day its important to enjoy it as much as you can and the express pass did that for us. There were only two rides that did not take express passes but they weren't significant rides and the queues for them were so long we gave them a miss. Every other ride we went on at least once. We spoke to a one lady at lunch who asked us about the passes as they had been at the park for 3 hours and only got on two rides - she was hoping to upgrade, which you can do. The park is fantastic fun with a great variety of rides and activities. The Waterworld show is a must see. Word of warning - if you go to the first show of the day most people will want lunch after it (like we did) - see if you can hold off as the food halls were packed and if you dont have a pass this is the time the queues would be at their smallest. Hold off until 1.30pm or so for lunch and it wont be anything like as busy. Like all things in Singapore, Universal Studios is exceptionally clean and well maintained. Remember if is hot hot hot so wear light clothes and bring a hat and sunscreen. We thought the food was a high standard - certainly compared to other theme parks.

I was utterly disappointed to see that it was just a waste of money to be charge a premium on the normal $30 for the express pass up to $90 and still has to wait for 45min for the rides. You guys have to look into this or else your guest satisfaction will surely drop.

To start with the ticketing system is rubbish, buying online in advance seemed to provide no benefit or time saving at all. I paid $78 online 4 months before visiting and at the last minute my wife decided to attend she paid $76 and got a $5 meal voucher and waited less time in the queue.  Once you clear that queue you need to join another one to collect your express pass if you have purchased one, i would NOT go if you cannot afford this pass. The lines are massive with almost all rides having a wait of over 45 mins, there is no air conditioning while you wait so it would be a very long hot day. I felt very sorry for the people i kept walking past to board the rides. 

The Madagascar area and Shrek area are for small children so if you are looking for excitement turn right on your arrival not left.  The Waterworld show is very average, great stunt work but just loud all over the show. The jurrasic park area is the biggest waste of time there is here, the Raptor offers no express access and the queues are massive, the river rapids ride is quite lame and expect to get your feet soaked. 

The mummy,  Battlestar and transformers are all quite good but not enough to make a great theme park. The food and drinks are insane prices even for Singapore, a small tray of chips will set you back $5, 6 chicken nuggets $7 and drinks $4 for a 320ml can. 

Unlike other Universal parks there is no studios, only the one ""show"" and no tours so a very different experience. 

Tip

Take sandals to wear on the rapids ride and leave your shoes in the locker or someone that is not riding. or save money and take a couple of plastic bags with you, if you think your kids will complain about getting the backside wet take a change of clothes.",Don't expect amazing only go if you can afford the queue jumper,2018-07-01,FAMILY,Bevan W,"Auckland, New Zealand",Auckland,New Zealand,1

The website,marketing and reviews gave us the impression that it is world class and rides are fabulous. Sadly the reality is that except for 3 or 4 rides/attractions the rest are mediocre at best. Families with small kids may find it wonderful but our teen kids did  not find it exciting except for the 2 Battlestar rides, jurassic park ride and the mummy ride. The transformers 4D ride is absolutely a let-down. As you go  in line for the transformer ride the mock up and props are great but the actual ride is a 4D movie with you moving about and is truly the worst let down at USS. The theme park in our home city of Johannesburg, Gold Reef City, has more thrilling attraction rides and rides that appeal to older kids and is way better value for money. Our feeling was that USS is definitely Overhyped and not worth the cost!!

The rides at Universal are so thrilling and they add so much adrenaline and excitement to our experience unlike those boring Disneyland rides. I have been to many big amusement parks in different countries and Universal Singapore definitely stands among the best. If you ever make a direct comparison between Universal Studios and Disneyland you will certainly know that Disney's are a boring place and specifically for kids whereas Universal has something for everyone and delivers to everyone's needs. The best rides at Universal for me were the Egyptian mummy roller coaster, the terrifying red-blue line roller coasters, the Hollywood and the Madagascar shows were also pretty amazing. There is so much to enjoy and discover at Universal. Just remember that each person (including children) should always carry a map to easily get around and reach the particular places for different show times.

We arrived prior to 10am (again as read from other reviews) but there were still medium sized queues. We were in the park by 1010am. Lost World isn’t open until 11am so we just started making our way around the park as it loops in a circle anyway. I would recommend by going right into ‘New York’ and making your way round that way but if you have small kids I would recommend going left into ‘Madagascar’ and making your way round that way. 

We got on 2 rides in the space of an hour to then look at the time board and see things had jumped to 40min-90min wait times. The wait times aren’t overly accurate as the first 2 rides we went on had a 5 min wait time but we ended up waiting close to 15mins. So when we saw 40mins we knew it would be closer to 1hour wait. We opted to buy express passes there and then for $80 which is £44 (online or in the park are the same price - which I think is very cheap compared to other Universal parks worldwide). 

We continued to make our way around the park with our express passes - waiting no more than 10 mins on rides that had normal queue times of over 1hour. 1 hour may not seem like a long time compared to other theme parks across the world but when you are travelling in a large group of 10 then I would definitely recommend buying an express pass.

The only criticism I have is that the show times should be on the parks map somewhere instead of on a separate sheet of paper as we didn’t realise this when picking up the map - so we didn’t have this information until we got to the show point to find out we were either 30mins early or just missed the start of the show by 10mins - so that was a slight inconvenience.  

Apart from that I would highly recommend Universal to anyone visiting Singapore but those that have been to Universal in Florida, you wont be disappointed but you will notice Florida is better and bigger.

We went on Mon July 9th, along with every kid (And family) on school hols from China, Taiwan and Taipei apparently. Queued for 1/2 hour to get tickets, we were aware there was an upgrade option for express access to the rides, but chose not to spend the additional S$120 on top of the standard S$78 per person for that benefit. 
Watching how this panned out during the day was an interesting overview of human behaviour, and a poor reflection on how the Capitalist system works. The Express Queues gradually increased in waiting time as more people came in, so they were waiting about half the time the standard ticket holders waited. The winners were those who used the ""Single Rider"" option, who basically walked to the front of the queue as they were happy to sit anywhere, not as a family unit. It was apparent that these were mostly the younger season ticket locals, who new how to beat the system.

The process was very annoying, and compared to say Tokyo Disney - very poor indeed.

As it turned out, the second ride we had queued in for 50mins broke down as we reached the front of the queue - it was the Jurassic Park Water Rapids -  which didn't help the mood. 
Tried to get into a New York diner for lunch - 1 hour wait time. Moved on.
We instead got some fast food from a themed restaurant, which was pretty ordinary.
So in summary - expensive, very busy, not much shade to escape the sun, really really long queues, and a faulty ride. Great Day - NOT.",Horrendous. The sadist who designed this should be strung up.,2018-07-01,FAMILY,Hodge67,"Sydney, Australia",Sydney,Australia,-1

We got our booking done from KlooK app which has discounts for the same pass bought on the counters.

Usually the express pass is 50$, but on our day of entry we paid 100$ each for express pass single entry. We were told that the price of express pass went up cause of the number of people that checked in.
So TIP is to get to the counters at the start , when it opens or end up paying double for the same pass.

If you have small kids, i would recommend you keeping your moeny aside for the xpress pass. Its well deserved.

There are few shows that happen on the streets, check the timings and before the show, reach the spot and reserve a spot in the front, cause it can get crowded.

We had a lovely guide on the day (tai) and loved that we were in a small group of 12, we were taken all around the park and taken on every ride. The advantage of the VIP ticket is you totally skip the line, go through the back doors and exits and find yourself at the front of the ride getting choice of seating position.

We were able to go on every major ride, some twice.  The Water world show was excellent and with the VIP tour you get to see it in an air conditioned box with cold drink!
The VIP tour comes with $25 vouchers per person to use at the restaurant which was great considering the price of food in Singagpore.

All in all our family had a totally memorable experience, one of which our family will look back on with awesome memories for a long long time.

We only had 2 days to spend in Sentosa so we decided to buy the Season's Pass with express to ensure we could skip the line and come back a second day if we wanted to. This was a mistake. We finished all the rides once in less than 3 hours and only 2 of the rides (The Mummy ride and Battlestar Galactica) were worth a second visit. The Transformers ride made my wife physically sick and the Puss n' Boots ride music was so loud and obnoxious I had to cover my ears. We did enjoy walking around the park, but most of the rides are tailored for children, and we were looking for a more thrilling experience.

We should have done more research before paying for the seasons pass + express. If I could go back in time, I would have only paid for the day pass, but I would have still been disappointed.

So before going I would strongly advise you to do your research beforehand regarding how much time you have & what rides you must do or can skip. Book the tickets before online which also provides you free WiFi access throughout the park. The theme park is in form of a circle around a central lagoon. Here are few tips to get best experience in relatively less time: 
1. I would strongly advise to avoid visiting during the weekends as cues can get longer with longer waiting times. If at all you have to visit on weekend then express pass is must (SGD 30 per head for single entry & SGD 50 for multiple entries in addition to the entree fee of SGD 76 per  head). We had got the one time express pass for SGD 30 & it did save us lot of time. 

2. Visit early by 10 am (opening time of the park) so that one can complete most of the important rides by 3-4 pm & then proceed to Sentosa for completing few of the rides there & lights n sound show in the evening if you have the stamina.

3. After you enter the park from the Hollywood street turn left as the ride cues are relatively lesser & by the time you come to right side the crowd is dispersed. 

4. Here is list of rides we did & I would recommend :
    a. Madagaskar: good for kids
    b. Shrek 4D adventure: A Must do
    c. Revenge of the Mummy: A Must do
    d. Jurassic world River Rapids do (had 
         the longest Q) & Canopy flier 
         rollercoaster :  A Must do 
    e. Waterworld (showtimes- 12.30, 2.30 &

    f. Transformers: A Must do
    g. Lights, camera, Action by Steven

    h. Battlestar Galactica- Human vs Cylon

Try and avoid peak days. 

Don’t buy the expensive queue-avoidance pass unless you need it. It costs more than the park ticket!!!

So, my recommendation is: plan which rides you want. Get there with your ticket at 9:50am. (I accidentally turned up at 9am so bought my ticket and went for a coffee in Starbucks). 

Don’t worry if the queue is 50 people in front of you at 10am. The park absorbs them. I found that the wit time for the rides was 5-15 minutes for until about 11am and then it gets longer. So:
- Arrive early
- Prioritize your rides [must]
- Save show and sign-ups until later [top tip]

My fringe comments would be: Waterworld show is great. Madagascar ride might be the first one you see but isn’t going to get the pulse racing, Treasurehunters is tepid so don’t wait a long time. Raptor training was fun for the kids. Food and drink is absolutely outrageously expensive, take your own.

But around 3 PM most guests had left and there was only 10 min wait even on the popular rides, so I’d recommend arriving after lunch (bonus: save money by not having lunch inside the park!).

Not being movie buffs, we were very skeptic about the visit as we were not sure if 76 SGD (~50 EUR) was worth it. Our experience was mixed. We wish we could have enjoyed more rides.

An extra star just for the Revenge of The Mummy and Transformer rides. We will remember them for rest of our lives!!

-	At 76 SGD for a day pass, it is EXPENSIVE. 
-	The popular rides had waiting time ranging from 35 to 80 minutes. So, we spent significant amount of our visit just waiting in the queues.
-	Because of the waiting time, we were pretty much forced to spend an entire day here to make most of 76 SGD.
-	We managed to be on only four rides and then simply gave up. Later we just walked around taking pictures.
-	We frequently found people jumping queues and the staff couldn't care less. While waiting in line for the ""Revenge of The Mummy"" ride, there was a group of men scattered across the queue-maze. After about 15 minutes the ones in the front started inviting the ones in the back to jump the queue while passing some lewd comments in their native language. There need to be a better queuing system in place (e.g. providing people with numbered tickets when they join the queue).

About the themes and rides:

-	Madagascar ride was ok. 
-	The lost world live show was good. However waiting time for most of rides was 60-80 mins. The rides also involved getting wet and we were not dressed appropriately for that. Though there were drying pods but we gave the rides a miss none the less.
-	The ancient Egypt had the best ride of all. The mix of graphics, fire and roller-coaster was excellent. Though waiting time was 35 mins, it was worth it.
-	The transformer ride in the Sci-fi city was also great. Again a very good mix of graphics  and roller-coaster.

2,596658522,2018-07-16,MOBILE,3,"So in direct comparison to other theme parks (any of the Florida ones, Alton Towers/Chessington in the UK), this is....ok. 

It has 2, maybe 3, “big rides” -namely: The “Cylon” part of Battlestar Galatica (soooo much better than the Human side) and the Transformers ride. This was very clever and I went back and rode it twice. The Jurassic Park rapids is also good - I was in the unlucky seat and got absolutely SOAKED. 

The waterworld live show was also surprisingly entertaining, considering it’s based on the most expensive film flop from like 25-30 years ago?? Some excellent stunts and I really enjoyed it. 
The mummy is ride is...meh. 

Other than that, well, that’s about it. Everything else is fairly tame, and/or aimed at kids (so fair play, if that’s what you’re after). For huge rollercoaster/thrill fans, there’s enough here to fill a day, but it doesn’t stack up at all against the likes of Alton Towers. 

Also - get there 30 minutes before opening. You’ll be in first and can walk straight up to the front on multiple rides like I did and beat the queues! 

One more thing - the locker thing is an absolute SCAM. For certain rides you HAVE to put your bag in a locker. Fair enough for me at the start of the day with zero queues, but after 45 minutes you have to pay $4 per 20 minutes for the locker - so if the queue is over 40 minutes you’re basically paying AT LEAST $4 on top to go on these rides.

0,596363148,2018-07-15,OTHER,4,"Having been almost half a dozen times in the past year (courtesy of a 6-month pass purchased by wifey), here are some tips I've gathered...

Disclaimer - I'm not a big amusement park fan

First of all, there are PLENTY of things to do... plan your day well, or suggest to extend over 2 days (or if you're a local, more worthwhile to buy an annual/semi-annual pass). Even after so many visits, there are still things we haven't managed to do!

Tips
 - Get an Express pass if you're only visiting for a day, it's not worth getting stuck in a queue for 45min or longer (which can happen fairly frequently)
 - Alternatively try to avoid peak times (weekends, school holidays). Also the queues for the rides seems to be less busy overall towards the late afternoon (but do check closing times - it varies from day to day)
 - Wear comfortable clothes/shoes, the only way to get around is walking. It can get hot, so remember to hydrate plenty.
 - If you have young kids (under 4yo), you'll only have a limited number of rides you can go on (due to height restrictions). Buddy up with another family, or be prepared to go alone when taking adult rides whilst one parent looks after the kids.
 - Don't expect fancy food options... you're at an amusement park
 - If you're a local and drive, get a RWS Invites card to try and redeem parking","Lots to do, especially if you're a fan",2018-07-01,FAMILY,Jason L,"Singapore, Singapore",Singapore,Singapore,1

Waiting 90 minutes in line for a roller coaster  with some cooling fans not running is hot, boring, and tiring. There are too many people trying to enjoy the ONLY THEME PARK in Singapore. The shortest time my son waited was 20 minutes for a not so popular ride.

However worst thing we experienced was racial discrimination, my 14 year old son tried to go down the single riders lane on his own and was told to join the other line, watching at a distance I noticed 2 minutes later non western guests allowed down the single riders line on multiple occasions. I felt like raising it with management then and there but that would only have completely ruined the day. I can say the not all attendants stopped him but one woman certainly discriminated against him.
Singapore is a tourist and transit hub, Sentosa is a great concept but it cant cope with the demand, you have to spend the entire day there to get any value for money. 3 rides in 270 minutes is as I said hot , boring and actually quite expensive.
Queensland's Goldcoast has just about got it right with multiple parks.

1,596033811,2018-07-14,OTHER,5,"Next Day, it was time for a daylong fun and entertainment at the much-famed world over theme park – The Universal Studios, which is truly universal in its appeal and amusement for everyone’s interest. 

The studio lies within Sentosa Island and is in the vicinity of the Sea Aquarium. Sky had opened and there were intermittent showers in the morning hour but then the overcast conditions settled down quickly and the dark clouds floated fast elsewhere. Even before the opening time of 10am, there was already a rush at the entry gates, but all the visitors had aligned themselves in their respective queues, well behaved, disciplined and in order. Outside the studio, a huge revolving spherical globe is installed with swoosh of large white coloured fonts of UNIVERSAL STUDIOS encircling with a tilt like the Saturn ring in the space.  Everyone, who visits here, will certainly, and happily, pose in front of this iconic globe shaped mascot of Universal Studios and click pictures in volumes.     

As we swiped our tickets and entered the supreme world of Universal Studio, the excitement begun to multiply exponentially, flowing with the flow – and why not as we had the entire day to explore and experience the Studio offerings.  The studio offers a wide range of state-of-the-art rides, live stunt shows, street entertainment, dinosaurs, 4D shows, movie making with Steven Spielberg’s Light-Camera-Action, 360-degree rollercoaster, Jurassic Park Rapids and many more amusements and attractions: full of fun, frolic and the thrills! And of course, with easy availability of much-needed food, beverages and refreshments options aplenty, the Studio comes alive for the entertainment of the taste buds and stomach too! The Studio is great for shoppers too offering multiple shopping options for a variety of goods, memorabilia and the merchandise alike.  

Among the attractions which prominently stands out, especially from my experience, are - The Revenge of the Mummy, Transformers 4D Ride, Shrek 4D Movie, The Water World Live Stunt Show, Rapids, Light Camera Action and the 360-Degree Rollercoaster.  

The Revenge of the Mummy ride welcomes you with gigantic warrior statues - colored in black and grey-golden standing tall, firm and mighty - on either side of its entrance. On board the circular cart inside, it takes you through a storyline about the Mummies with an exhilarating ride which has many moods and motions, it - rotates, revolves, speeds, shocks and moves backward, forward, sideways with sudden starts-stops, accelerations, shakes and also sprinkles water for bugs effect - and passes through an amazing gallery of an audio-visual journey with a mesmerising surround sound which will certainly leave you in complete awe and impact. A thrilling experience which one cannot miss once being inside! Outside, one can see the traces of Ancient Egypt; with structures, statues and ruins recreated for a real feel of that era gone by. 

A similar ride experience, with much more and superior shakes and shocks, comes alive once you get into the Transformers 4D, wherein the Transformer is trying to save you from the rampaging evils to the safety of your life. The Transformer experience will leave you spellbound. Shrek-4D movie is also an enthralling watch as you go through the emotions and motions by feeling the jerks and bumps sitting on a cushy chair inside the movie hall. And, finally, ride the high speed 360-Degree rollercoaster only if you have a strong heart and don’t fear the super speedy sudden wavering falls and upside-down-revolutions and the equally momentous and swift forward movements, this ride will surely give you the never before adrenaline rush! Spielberg’s Light-Camera-Action is also a must visit to see how special effects and sound creates the incredible scene of Category-5 hurricane hitting the New York city – truly an amazing way of movie making: shooting hurricane like situation and devastation inside a film studio, appears so real on the screen! 

By 6pm, we were done with almost all the rides and visit to the various attractions. On our way out, we saw a bit of Dinosaurs act being played out in the open stage inviting children from among the public, to experience the Dino up there closer to the giant raptor in action. It was indeed a fun filled and an enjoyable day for all of us.

Starting from Harbour front station - Sentosa monorail there was no proper queuing system - people just rushed and pushed to get into the train - while angry staff at train door shouting on top of his voice ‘WAIT FOR NEXT TRAIN !!!’ I was quite shock at this behavior for first world lSingapore standard dealing with international tourists.
The same for return trip - heard one Aussie family complained - been literally pushed by staff into the train in order to close door ! 
At Discovery Food Court - chicken rice counter, grumpy and rude server named ‘Shirley’ humilating tourists (in mandarin) - ‘DON’T LOOK IF YOU NOT BUYING!!’ 
Same at Cylon photo booth - disgruntled counter staff lose patience when ask for further information.
It’s time USS re-train staff the importance of customer service and be professional. Employ qualified and service oriented staff. 
Theme park is not only about the hardware and facility - it’s the staff that create fun cheerful atmosphere or the opposite. 
Look at Tokyo Disney for top tips - every staff is friendly, smiling and ready to offer assistance. 
Another issue is the fast pass which cost more than the ticket ! Ridiculous ! 
Follow Tokyo Disney, all popular rides has fast pass machine that gives out certain number of fast track tickets every hour  -first come first serve basis. 
Problems with lockers - can’t open with finger print (about 5 others with same problem) waited 10 mins for staff to open. 
Staff manning rides queues looked annoyed and not interested. (time to change job!)

1,595508651,2018-07-12,OTHER,4,"Okay, after saying possibly not ever returning, we gave in to the kids pleading, for trip #2.

Everything I previously suggested still holds true, and I can't emphasize enough the need to buy tickets with express passes (for a more enjoyable day) online beforehand. 

I did this time, and was initially annoyed that e tickets were not sent to me (my US based credit card apparently wasn't trustworthy). However, making the purchase online allowed us to avoid the opening rush. We arrived about 10:45 or so, at that time, there was about a 15 minute queue at the ticket sales booth (yes, there was a sign advising of wait time there too!), but buying online allows you to skip the ticket sales booth. We headed to the Guest Services desk (blue counter immediately behind ticket sales booths) where there was no queue at that time, and retrieved our tickets and express pass wristbands (we would have had to stop by somewhere to get those express passes anyway, either Guest Services or a few other locations inside the park, for those who do get e tickets).

So another advantage of buying online was the savings on the express pass. Because we were here for a few weeks, I was able to compare prices on unlimited express passes to see if any weekdays were better. All days I checked were $80 (weekends were $100); I eventually bought tickets on a Friday for the following Tuesday. Tuesday morning, just for fun (since we didn't have to get to USS super early) I checked prices, and the unlimited express pass had increased from $80 to $110, yikes! That adds up very quickly if you are a family.

Seems that the lockers (for those rides where you cannot bring anything with you) are free for the amount of time the regular queue is, and with the express pass, there is never a worry of running out of time. 

The only other changes (from our last visit) are that the park was now open until 8 pm, and the slushies have increased to $6 ... inflation, presumably. 

BTW, for all you xiao long bao fans, there is a Din Tai Fung just outside. Since everyone knows food won't be cheap inside USS, might as well spend that money for tasty xiao long bao (which we did sans the long wait that we usually have at the Santa Clara Din Tai Fung). Easier to do if you have express passes, since you will have all that free time not stuck (and likely getting irritable) waiting in those crazy long queues!

After struggling to purchase tickets online, we ended up with help from our hotel, but didn't purchase the Express pass beforehand as we were told to wait and see.  We quickly purchased them for 100 per adult one we arrived and sits not regret it. 
We could ride what we wanted when we wanted and it allowed us to see pretty much the entire park over the course of the day. 

Highlights were the Transformer ride, the Cylon rollercoaster, and the Mummy.  The little fella absolutely loved Elmos Tv time as well, even if was a little loud for him. 

Staff across the entire park were very friendly, especially with my son, who enjoyed some one on one time with Ernie, Abby and Grover as they came out for the meet and greet. 
While his mum and I would of loved to see him meet Elmo, we were ecstatic that they took a few minutes time with him before going into the main street. 

There were very few 'infant' friendly rides, by that was to be expected. 

We loved that staff in each section were all dressed thematically, little attention to detail things like this just help add to the enjoyment in my opinion. 

The biggest let down were the hotdogs from the fossil fuels station, as they were tiny for their cost and we weren't really sure what some of the toppings were.

Overall we had a fantastic day and would love the chance to come back once day in the future when our son is older so he can enjoy even more.  While everything was fairly expensive, this is a theme park and we did expect it.

Only slight negative I experienced related to the use of a $5 voucher for retail stores for a minimum spend I had as part of a MasterCard promo. I had two vouchers but the retail shop wouldn’t allow you to combine them. I had the same voucher for food and beverage and could combine them.

As soon as we entered we went to the Universal Store and upgraded to the $70 Express Pass (Per person). We didn't think we would go on any ride more than once however, if you plan it well, the kids can use the adults express pass on the rides they want to go on more than once.

The other Express Pass is $100 PP which allows unlimited rides. We didn't see much difference between the two passes on the day.

The $70 PP extra seems a lot but it's worth every cent. There was upwards of a 70 minute wait on some rides whereas the longest we waited was maybe 10 minutes and that was often because the ride or attraction was already in motion.

The food was expensive but you can bring your own a save money. Pack it in ice as it's hot in there with little shade.

Expect to pay SGD300 entry for a family of four after which you’ll be waiting an average of 60 to 70 minutes per ride, longer on the premium rides like Transformers and the Jurassic Park tube ride (which incidentally broke down twice during our visit, both times we were 30-40 minutes into the line). We also wasted 20 minutes in the line of a kiddie coaster that broke down. Standing in queue after queue trying to entertain your increasingly hot and crabby kids is probably not what holidays are supposed to be about.
Apart from a few scheduled shows, the rest of the park is overpriced food and beverage outlets and gift shops.
If your heart is set on going regardless, be sure to fork out another SGD 30 per person and get an express pass that will shorten your waiting times somewhat (can be used once per ride, or SGD 50 per person for unlimited), although for a family of four, first stop and think about what else you could do for $500.

A standard USS ticket can be purchased online or at the entry gate and costs 76 SGD (includes 5 SGD meal and 5 SGD retail vouchers). You might also get additional discounts if purchasing tickets online with a MasterCard powered debit/credit card. Having said that, I must mention that you will most likely be disappointed if you've not purchased the Express pass (price varies by day). For the most popular rides, the wait time usually is 60-80 minutes and this wait will swiftly eat away your time, not to mention how mentally and physically draining it can be. The Express pass will reduce the wait time to 10 minutes per ride. You see the difference now, don't you. Despite having the Express Pass, it took me and wife about 6 hours to cover about 75% of USS. You can imagine how long it will take someone to cover the park without it.

Coming to the park itself, it has quite a few attractions for people of all age groups. They have these Meet and Greet sessions with movie characters where kids can get pictures clicked and meet their favorite animated stars, movie making sessions, live shows and the biggest attraction, the rides themselves. All of this is divided based on themes. They have some interesting rides at the Jurassic World and Ancient Egypt. The roller coasters are a must try and the best of them all is the Transformers ride. Don't miss out on it, come what may. Since these ride are high speed and turn you upside down, there ask all guests to remove all accessories and put them in a locker. A full day locker costs 20 SGD or 4 SGD per hour with a cap of 20 SGD. They also have free to use lockers at some rides where wait times are high. These lockers however have a time limit. They're free only for 45 mins, after which they cost 4 SGD per hour with a maximum of 20 SGD for a day. Be aware of this or you'll end up paying quite a bit.

The food at USS although looks to be prepared hygienically lacks in taste and is extremely overpriced. You're better off heading out of USS for your meals.

It was the evening my family awaited for two months and we were all set to buy the annual pass. But the experience in USS was so poor that forget annual pass it was a bad, tiring, sweaty experience. Reason? USS kept bare thin staff to operate so some rides had just one staff instead of the standard 2-3 staff. Same staff would go round closing all doors, fixing all belts, closing all Exit dates before a round started and then do the same after the round finished. The waiting time was eternity when on that exclusive night waiting time should have been minimal. What did USS gain by saving cost of 40-50 more employees on duty? In DBS Bank, customer experience is our big focus area and in USS that’s the least focus area. How would USS feel if we say waiting period for credit into account is 90 hours or 30hrs (same as proudly USS flashes their waiting time?) .. created only by reducing staff and increasing hype? We were there in USS for 4 hours, picked only the rides with 5-15mins wait time and yet could only do 5 rides in 4hrs, tired more of waiting than anything else. For the bomb money you charge, the over expensive toys and food inside, you should be ashamed to proudly flash your high waiting time and poor customer service and experience.","High on hype and cost, Low on customer experience",2018-07-01,FAMILY,Avijit Das Patnaik,"Singapore, Singapore",Singapore,Singapore,-1

2,594182011,2018-07-08,OTHER,1,"The park had an early closure on 7/7/2018 at 6PM instead of 10PM as stated on their website on 7/7/2018, or 8PM as the usual closure time. 

The park intentionally avoid informing its guests at ticket sale, park entry or anywhere else in the park on the day.  Guests would only find out at 6PM exactly at every ride entry, that ""the park is closed now for private event, ALL rides and restaurants are closed. Please proceed to the exit right now"".

You then will be ushered to the exit with no further explaination, as 17,000 others enters the park for this private event which is ""DBS Family Day"".

There are so many occasions that we as customers could be informed of this closure: 1. online purchase upon selecting date; 2. ticket sales counter; 3 park entry; 4. notice board placed in the park. But there is NONE!!!  According to the staff at Guest Service Center, USS did not do any of the above because ""the park will not know when you are leaving, you might leave before 6pm anyway"". 

With this attitude from USS, you wouldn't be surprised to find that If you urge for a refund, they will refund your entrance ticket back to your credit card; but If you didn't specify ""I DEMAND A REFUND"" or just left with dissappointment, the park will just do nothing. 

Funny enought, if you googled ""Universal Studio Singapore Opening Hour"" on 7/7/2018, you will see ""10AM TO 10PM"",  instead of it's usual ""10AM TO 8PM"" timing, with no ""reserved for private event after 6pm"" anywhere. Many tourist are shocked that they are chased out at 6pm as they thought it closes at 10PM.

The entrance ticket is $78 per adult, and customers should be entitled to enjoy the facilities of the park from 10am till 8pm. It is surely unacceptable that the park does not do any of its part to inform its customers affected, and chase everyone out at 6pm for its private event.

0,594171920,2018-07-08,MOBILE,2,"In a nutshell, if you are European or American and ever been to a decent theme park, chances are you won't be impressed by Universal Studios Singapore and will be seriously annoyed at the high ticket prices.  This is clearly not how it is in the US.  We were a family of 3 with a 6 year old boy. The park and rides are pretty average while the price of admission and queues are huge. The day we went they wanted $90 per person for an Express Pass. The rides are pretty much all normal fairground /theme park rides you will have done anywhere else, but with character branding. Eg Madagascar's crate ride is just the flume. Jurassic Park’s main ride is your average circle boat ride etc. 80mins+ for the popular rides. There aren’t many rides and it's not a big theme park. The rides are in the minority to expensive food and shops cashing in on the branding, which is what all this park is about. The only thing worth seeing is the Waterworld show which is great fun. At least half the""rides"" use cinema screens and are pushed as 4D experiences. In reality they’re cheap budget rides to pack in a lot of people and aren’t that impressive. The day we were there wasn’t even peak season and it was rammed. Some ""rides"" we were rushed out before it had barely finished (Shrek), some we queued for ages and then it was shut (Jurassic Park water - 80 mins of queuing and then shut). The place is also not child friendly! Which is bizarre because it's for kids! The seats on some of the 4D rides were far too big for most kids and they couldn't see properly and there wasn’t actually that much for kids in relation to being an adult. Eg, why aren't all the “characters” out all day meeting and greeting? Instead they come out for 10 mins every few hours so the kids can have photos taken and there are queues. Then they have to turn kids away because 10—15 mins is the allocated time and hey have to go in. When we went to meet the Transformers, they didn't come out at all because of a bit of rain earlier and it was slippery on the ground. You would have thought a company like Universal would have figured how to walk on tiles with a tiny bit of water.

If you have nothing else to do and don’t mind blowing a fortune on entry, go. But we did other things that were still pricey but at least worth the money, like the megazip, the Luge etc. Universal Studios is mediocre at best and quite honestly a rip off.

0,594155067,2018-07-08,MOBILE,1,"It was fun when I visited USS with university mates 8 years ago. Planned a re-visit with friends on 7/7/2018. We anticipated, we can’t wait for the revisit. We planned our riding schedule so that we could cover all the rides, knowing it’s a crowded weekend. We can’t afford to take a day off from work just for USS. So we took up the challenge to visit on a weekend.  Was very happy in the morning, though it’s crowded, we praised USS management that there’s still sufficient rides for every games. The queue was long but smooth. 

 Till 5.30pm, It was such a steep plunge on emotion, when we were told “sorry, you need an orange band to ride this?” “Why?” “There’s a private event” “why you guys didn’t inform when we bought the tickets”. Silence in return and no words from the staffs. 

Do you even know what’s consumer rights? Your customer bought a FULL PRICE ticket but didn’t get to enjoy their full rights as visitors. The opening hours listed on your website is 10am to 10pm. HOW IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE TO REFUSE YOUR CUSTOMERS from taking the rides when it was only 5.30pm and your staffs were left with nothing but a difficult position to apologize to everyone who wasn’t wearing an orange band (private event, so it seems)?!!! We are deeply disappointed with the way this situation is handled!!

 And we definitely want to demand for a FULL REFUND ! Please response on this post and refund full for 5 tickets!!!

We do not care about whether it’s DBS 50th anniversary or be it your poor management? Perhaps you should learn to respect your customers. We will file this situation with CASE for sure to get back the compensation of money and time.

The queues to get tickets were small but it was still fairly busy inside the park with some rides up to an hour and a half wait.

The queues for the Cylon and Battle Galactica were slightly longer but still less than half an hour.  

The architecture of the park is brilliant as the buildings are all in good condition, kept very clean and aesthetically pleasing. In particular, the Shrek and Jurassic Park sections were great photo opportunities and very like the real films. 

The food is okay, as to be expected from a theme park it’s not the cheapest but you can grab a hotdog, chips and large soft drink for around 15 Singapore dollars which isn’t bad.

Event we spent SGD70/person for express ticket, we have to wait about more than 1 hour (so why they said it is a express ticket?). The most ridiculous one is transformer game. We have to queue 3 hours to reach the place to enjoy the game. But then, the staff didn't allow my son to enjoy the game as he is not tall enough. I said, why nobody notice that with us before queuing? She said (with a rude way) 'So many clients and they are unable to manage that'. oh my god! how professional are they? Why such of kind people can work in the hospitality environment? I wonder that is a Singaporean style? In addition, I also mentioned that if you see and aware, the long queue with so many people are waiting and it is out of their control, you should stop the customers at a main gate with a notice to let the customers bear in mind of that. 
Regarding the way for queuing, you will queue indoor, if you are in the middle of line and wish to get out, you have to wait until you see the exist door which is for evacuation but it is very small door, If any emergency case, I don't think it is enough space for around 500 people. I extremely could not understand why they have a smart building like that. If you go with your family, I am strongly recommended you that this place is not suit with your family at all (especially, if your children are under 4 years old).

- cheaper tickets since you only have a few hours to explore at night
- cooler to walk around, less crowds and queues. In fact, we got on all the ride in less than two minutes
- the castles were luminescent at night. Even better was that the lights were glowing a different colour ever so often and my daughter loved that she could capture a photo with a purple castle!
- simply gorgeous Christmas lightings and festive-looking streets!
- special Christmas shows with Santa, acrobatic elves on stilts no less, and real flying fairies (on wires ha!)
- the confetti and fake snow (foam) are just more visible and more magical at night

Too small & too crowded.

Too hot at most attractionwaiting lines while waitingques are hours at the attractions. Unlimited express lane is not enough to beat the ques so you are forced to wait hours anyway and wont be able to ride all attractions in one day. Skip this activity.

Long version:

After reading several guides before visiting universal studio singapore, USS, we went early morning well prepared on a monday before they open, a weekday to avoid crowds

According to a guide it was not worth buying express lane tickets unless its high season weekend. Luckily I didnt follow that advice. I had a bad feeling at morning when I saw all people waiting to enter so I did buy 2 unlimited express lane tickets. This made the entrance almost double as expensive. It was worth it anyway.

Lets start by clarifing that not all attractions have express lines. Meaning you will need to wait even longer on some attractions. Despite having an express line ticket the waiting lines could be up to half an hour and even more. And its very hot in many attraction lines when yout wait making it very uncomfortable to wait and destryoing the mood. After all you are there to enjoy your time, not sweat like a animal in a crowd of others. And you do buy express lane just to buy time. Express is supposed to be something fast, I didnt except to spend more than 4 hours during our day on ques when using express lane, I dont dare to even think what would have happend if we didnt buy express line tickets. USS should rename this to faster line and not express line. This is not even close to express when you spend more than halft an hour waiting. Express should be no more than 5 minutes. That is ofcourse the fault of USS that the express lines are so long. Because USS is more after quantity than quality. They could actually limit the number of guests so waiting lines would be shorter and express lines would be express and not long waiting lines. But USS just wants to earn as much money as possible. Add to that the fact that express line system is poorly implemented. People cheating and moving from normal line to express line, later beeing let on the ride despite not having right tickets. I also saw people without the express lane band beeing let into express line. Add to that they let in 50% of people from the normal line on a ride then 50% from express line making the waiting longer on express line than what is expected from an express line. Express my as…

Many guests are rude in general. Either they gonna stamp you from behind, bump into you, push you away, try to get before you without appologizing or do all. Add to that the noiselevel at the waiting lines. It just feels so uncivilized.

The food is expensive as in most other places like this. One strange thing is the egyptian city has one food place and its serving indian food and not arabic food. Doest make any sence.

The rides themself are fun, some of them. But most of them are very short. But considering all the heat, crowds and waiting time you will not enjoy your time, not be able to try all rides and propably get your mood destroyed.

So my advice is, avoid visiting USS unless you never been to any themeparc, are so desperat to ride attracations and dont mind heat crowds, rude guests. … After all this is just Another themparc, not in anyway the best out there and you could easily skip it. Actually you should skip it and invest your time in other activities in this Beautiful city.",Skip Universal Studio :(,2018-07-01,COUPLES,ArameanTraveller,"Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm,Sweden,-1

Take Sentosa express (this is Sentosa station) and alight at water front station (which is first station). (b) Taxi/ grab is cheapest and fastest mode.

You can buy USS ticket either at Sentosa station or outside USS.

Donot go to USS over the weekend to avoid the crowd (though one will miss Hollywood dreams parade and Lake Hollywood spectacular which happens only on Saturday).

Drinking water available at water fountains around the park. Have empty drinking bottles with you.

Tips for conquering queues
- Come early
- First take rides and take pictures later. Do not waste your time to look for souvenirs or merchandises as you can do it later.
- Get the Express Pass to use the fast lane. No express line for Treasure Hunters and Canopy Flyer rides. If you have express pass, please do these first.
Express tickets are of 2 types – (a) express ticket (which allows skipping the line once for each ride) – its base price is S$30; (b) express ticket unlimited (which allows skipping the line for unlimited time) – its base price is S$ 50. The price of these tickets is dynamic and keeps on increasing depending upon the crowd. Generally, these are available at S$ 50 and S$ 80 respectively. In fact, if these are available at base price (of S$ 30 and S$ 50), it may indicate that there is not much crowd and one may try not to buy it.

Express ticket is available either (a) online only if you buy admission ticket at official site or (b) at ticket counter or many shops inside the USS. These are not available from agents, offline or online like klook.

If one plans to avoid buying express ticket, reach by 9.30 and when gates open at 10, first try to take these rides - transformer, revenge of mummy, Battlestar Galactica Human & Cylon and then Jurrassic park (this opens at 11 AM) and then shrek 4D, enchanted airways. These are the rides where you will find longest queues.

If you have a baby or a toddler in your group, you can use the 'child swap' program- one person babysits while the others are queuing, whenever everyone has done, the person who looks after the baby can enjoy the ride without queuing. Ask for it to the attendants standing in front of each ride, they will assist you. Prepare to get wet for Jurassic Park Rapid Adventure. Either carry your own ponchos or buy one at the USS Stores. There are also drying pods outside the rides if you didn’t wear a poncho and find yourself soaked. Use of the drying pods is chargeable.

See the map of USS available on the website prior to visit. USS is not very big. You can come back to any zone later if you would want.

You can collect the map along with details relating to show timings/ schedule at the entrance. Waterworld is a must-watch show.

Short-cut to reach transformer - just head down the path in-between Mel’s Drive-In and the lake, make your way past the wharf and you will arrive at Sci-Fi City, right in front of TRANSFORMERS and the Battlestar Galactica roller coasters. From here, it is a short walk to the Ancient Egypt zone.

Lockers are available next to these rides to stow away your bags and other loose items before embarking on some of rides. These lockers are free for use for a limited time (first 45 minutes).

First you have to Redeem your online booking by queuing at a booth near the train station. 
Once you have redeemed your booking for a voucher you take the voucher to the Customer Service Desk and queue again and they then give you a pile of tickets for entry to the park. A fast pass cost $80 per person but doesn’t actually cover the 4 biggest rides and waiting times for these we 95 minutes and it wasn’t a busy day. Universal Singapore isn’t like the well oiled machine of Universal Florida. 
We bought a 2 day ticket. We wanted to visit Universal on day 1 and probably Sea World but we’re told that Sea World falls in to what is considered day 2 activity and is grouped with other attractions so as soon as we activate Sea World we have to do all the other attractions as well on the same day or we “lose them”. So in effect, you can only do Universal on day 1 and do the rest on day 2. This isn’t explained on the web. When we asked Guest/Customer Service they told us we didn’t have enough “credits” to go in to the Sealife Centre. We said we didn’t understand but went to the Sealife Centre ticket desk anyway where we were told we did have a ticket to get us in and a ticket for the Maritime Museum.

I would highly recommend splurging for the express pass though, as that saved us HOURS waiting in a queue.  Especially if it happens to be hot out and you are someone who is sensitive to body smells... I can promise you won't enjoy the rooms you stand in for nearly an hour, sardined with everyone else. 

With the express pass, we also only got the ""one-time"" use and found it to work out just fine since we only planned on being there for a few hours anyway.  I would say Battlestar Galactica and the Transformers rides were the two most memorable. We did the Jurassic Park water ride too and it was fun (you don't get real wet either).  Unfortunately, the Mummy ride was inop when we went so we weren't able to ride it -- I heard that it was one of the better rides though.

We didn't really eat anything from there, there's quite a bit of food to choose from if you just walk out of the park.

There are certain games / attraction cant found in Singapore or Japan. Such as back to the future, harry potter, Jaws etc which are not available in Universal studio  Singapore .  Both are different experience. 

23 June 2018 , Saturday evening time 2000hrs is a special event / private function. Below information is based on 23 June 2018 evening event and do note that USS does not open late night for everyday. 

Due to certain reason that some attraction, food store, souvenirs shops are not available for that evening. That day we left USS after 0000hrs and that day is also our little kiddo exactly 3 mth old. 

A lot of transports entering Sentosa such as bus, taxi etc . There are two types of uss ticket available which are normal and express ticket. Ticket express allows you skip long queue but there certain rules applied. 

Remember collect white brochure / leaflets and studio guide so that you can properly plan during the trip. 

That night we played and watched 2000hrs to 0000hrs:
Madagasacar , A crate adventure , Far Far Away , Pus in boot’s giant journey . Madagascar , King Julien’s beach party go round . The lost world , water world . 

Waiting time for each attraction:
Certain games need to wait for 5min to 30mins subject to crowd. 

Any height limit for every ride:
Yes , certain games got height limit. My 3mths kiddo ride Madagascar , King Julien’s beach party go round . And can only seat can chariot and accompany by adult. 
There are certain show and game that we didn’t explore around due to time constraint ( 2000hrs to 0000hrs). 

Dining area:
Yes,  it is available and different café available. that evening we ate at FAR FAR AWAY , R6 Goldilocks . But price for one meal is expensive then outside. 

Any live character / mascot for photo shooting:
Yes , live characters / mascot appears at certain timing and designated area. Check at white brochure / leaflets for more information.  That night we took pictures with character / mascot at Madagascar , Madagascar Boogie , S4 .
Please be considerate that you need to queue up and don’t cut queue . 
There is another live character / mactor minion at Hollywood , outside minion mart , P4 but  unfortunately the queue has closed when we approach for it. 
If missed take picture with live characters . Don’t worry there are status near the area and you can take picture with it . 

Can take picture and video during game and show:
Certain game and show does not allow you take picture and video. check with the staff or read the instruction .

Taking pictures at night and day :
There are different especially night time is very dark and certain object cant capture into pictures.  

Souvenir shops: 
Mainly a lot of souvenirs can find at Hollywood. My advise purchase those souvenirs after you have complete your game / show . otherwise you need to carry those carriers around.  Proper planning  is important  as certain souvenirs only available at certain shop such as ancient Egypt shop . 

Smoking area : 
Only at designated area .

Baby changing area:
It is available near the wash room

Stroller rental:
It is available for rental near the main entrance , guest service .
But we bring our own stroller instead and do ensure that you park your stroller at designated area outside each attraction . 

Feeding room for baby:
Unknown , please check with USS

Locker service:
It is available and there are few near the main entrance, guest service. 
Inside certain attractions, locker service is available  

Overall experiences: Night and day time has different especially certain games / dining area has closed. Night Crowd are much lesser than day time.   Game waiting time is very subjective.

0,590104240,2018-06-23,OTHER,4,"A place to Visit in Singapore. Some of the rides will make your trip all the more worthy.
Do not miss 
1) the Transformers, - 4D expereince - Its legendary
2) The Cylon and Human Roller Coaster rides
3) The Water World Stunt show,
4) the Shrek 4D Movie.
I believe the Revenge of the Mummy is also a good ride, but this is something i could not experience given the volume of visitors and the waiting time for the rides.

Pack yourselves a set of Wet wipes and bottled water and you are all set to go. 
There are eateries and restaurants inside the Studios which serve decent food (and yes they are expensive than the hotels outside, but then you have little choice other than bringing our own snacks).

On an extremely busy day expect at least 90 mins to 120 mins of waiting time for each of the shows i listed above (except the Water world, which has a huge theatre/arena and you may be lucky to find a place there sooner). The Extremely long queues and waiting times for a 2 to 5 minutes of Ride experience may appear ridiculous, but they are worth it. 

Based on my experience, here is a quick tip for which you will thank me. Do not get into the Transformers 4D ride during the morning hours, go there at the end of the day (around 5 pm), and you should virtually find no queue. In fact we went on this ride twice in succession with a zero queue experience in the evening. (The same ride took us close to 1.5 hours in the morning).

Its a place to visit with Kids and Grand Parents alike and something you should not miss at Singapore.

For an extra 65 SGD on top of your ticket you can skip the long queues and enter the express line. This is one good way to ensure that you can experience Many rides on a single day, which otherwise you cannot take due to the time taken for each ride. For those of you who can afford an additional 65 SGD per person, this is the best option to beat the queues.

Lockers are needed to park your bag and other loose stuff when going for some rides.  Lockers are free for 1st half hour and are you are charged after that.

Only criticism  I would give is:

Bars- it needs just 1 bar in so we can grab a beer. They have them in the states parks and at 4pm most folk like a cold beer when on holiday especially in this heat.

1. The Lost World 
2. Ancient Egypt 
3. Sci- Fi City 
4. New York 
5 Far Far Away

1) We reached around 11am on Saturday and started with the most famous ride ""Transformers""   in Sci-Fi Zone It was the best ride of all. The 5D simulation of Transformer is the best simulation ever experienced.

2) Then we proceeded to Cyclon and Human which are the 2 roller coasters in Sci-Fi

3) From there we moved on to ""the Mummy"". in Ancient Egypt section. It was just mind Blowing

4) Then we went to see 4D Shreik movie show in Far Far East

5) After that, we went to Jurassic World and did the rides there...It was so mind-blowing and actually transforms you to Dinosaur World.  Huge credit to engineers who have made this possible

6) By this time there was ""Water World"" show.. We sat on Soaking seats and had the fun of lifetime

0,587326095,2018-06-13,MOBILE,1,"We were so excited to go here with our two young kids and decided to go on a weekday to try and avoid the crowds as much as possible. After paying hundreds to get in, the lines for the rides were incredible. 

- The Madagascar ride said 10 minutes wait but we waited for over 30 for a five minute ride. Our two young boys were highly agitated by the end.
- Simple carousel with a 5 minute wait time ended up being a 20 minute wait because the poor girl operating it needed another person to help.
- The queues for the rides were astronomical on average 45 minutes and up to 80 minutes for the good rides! There is no way we could wait for that long rendering the ticket useless for any of the rides
- The biggest issue that angerred us was the blatant opportunism of the premium pass option. It was for sale for $50 online the day before then $80 at the gate. We didn't know the price would rise so much at the gate. After going in and experiencing the ridiculous time waiting for rides we went to buy a premium pass only for them to have risen in price again to $100! ""Because it's busy"". Rubbish. They know people will be fed up with waiting so they push the prices up more. 
- The food and souvenirs were way overpriced
- The shows were good, at least we didn't have to wait an hour to see them. 

Overall there is no way we will be back and feel throughly ripped off. My hard earned money was wasted. Unless you buy a premium pass there's no point going on the rides unless you are willing to wait for literally hours.",Waste of Time and Money,2018-06-01,FAMILY,DeanR,,,,0

There were many amusement that were handled by just one person, example, the carousel ride at Madagascar. He had to operate the ride, do checks, crowd control and everything by himself. There were lots of ceiling fans in the queue area but none was turned on as he couldn’t leave his station. It was terribly hot and everyone had to fan themselves using the map or own mobile fan. Another hiccup would be that certain photo taking opportunity was only for certain group of people but was not specify at all. Example there was a mascot just for a company event so the staff rejected us for taking photo with it and my girls cried. This was not the only example. Taking photo with the singers from Mel’s Diners was rejected too. However despite all these we as a family enjoyed our day at USS.

1,586844101,2018-06-11,OTHER,5,"A very famous adventure theme park in Sentosa. We went on a week day, had already bought the tickets from a tour and travel agent in Singapore. I got the ticket at SGD $ 68/ per person , while if you buy it from the counter it cost SGD $76. 
The Park opens at 10:00 AM, we reached there at around 9:45am, looking at the crowd and also having read lot of reviews about waiting time, we decided to buy the universal express pass. There was ambiguity related to price for single entry Universal express pass, as online it was showing SGD$ 30, while it was for SGD $50 / per person at the counter. 

We entered the Park and went to Transformer ride, since there was only 5min waiting early morning we decided not to use the pass and went ahead with the ride in normal line. It is one of the best rides in Universal studio. Post that we went to two roller coaster in normal line as the waiting was only upto 15mins. By the time we went to Mummy ride the waiting time was upto 45mins, then we started using out express pass and in 3 hours we covered the whole amusement park. By 2:30 PM  we have done all the rides.
We again then went to Transformer, Human & Cyclone Roller coaster, this time using express pass as the waiting time for each of the ride was close to 70 mins. As the day progresses the waiting time for most of the rides increase. 

Top Activities:
1) Transformer Ride
2) Both the roller coaster - Human & cyclone
3) Waterworld Show - Amazing live action show (Must Watch) -3 Shows in a day do watch out for the timings.
4) Canopy Flyer
5) Steven Spielberg Show - Must watch (Visual effects)

Tips
1) By the ticket from outside as its cheaper (You will save at least 8-10 SGD/ Ticket
2) Start early - Reach there by 10 am. 
3) Buy an express pass else you would have to wait 45-60 mins for top rides.
4) If not buying the express pass, one can go in single rider line as there is hardly 5-10 mins waiting time for single rider.
5) Do keep the universal studio layout in hand and sort out the rides you definitely want to go. Start with the top ones, Early morning one can do it without the need of any express pass or waiting time
6) For the roller coaster rides - One has to go empty pocket, so use the lockers to keep your stuff, Locker are free for 45 mins- In case of long waiting time, you will have to pay for the lockers as well",Great Theme Park!!,2018-06-01,COUPLES,Ashish V,"New Delhi, India",New Delhi,India,1

Certainly a lot to do, the park is divided into themed sections so that if there is something you'd want to see first, you can expedite travel to the theme section of choice. We did the anticlockwise walk around the park.

There is a lot of waiting, especially for the adrenaline rides ie. Coasters and the like. Many also require you to empty pockets so that things don't go flying off, but lockers are available for hire if there isn't a willing friend who doesn't want to ride.

Food in the park is OK, we went fried chicken with tater tots in Far Far Away land - very decent.

The Mummy ride - oh ho, starts slow and then comes the fear, let me not say more, try em out 

The puss in boots ride - Another crazy one 

Tip - Make sure you get the agenda of all the rides at customer service - plenty of lockers all over - Do not get the ones at the entrance as the place is huge and then if you need to get something from your locker its a long walk back. Also some rides and attractions have a specific time.

The dino ride - a kiddy one but still fun - fly em dino

Food are, as expected, costly inside. But you can always leave the park and visit the nearby food court for a cheaper (albeit not too cheap) alternative. Your ticket allows you to re-enter the park later.

We headed in super excited but found that there were only very few rides and the park is incredibly small. 

Maybe if you've never been to Florida before this might not be so disappointing, I can't say because Florida is epic! 

Here there were long lines but that part didn't really even matter because there are only like 5 rides that would be worth going on so if you have all day why not stand in line. Battlestar Galactica, The Mummy, Transformers and Jurassic Park raft.

What kind of bothered me was it seemed like they just didn't care. I mean US is known for ingenuity and creativity but this park seriously lacks that. It all just looks like a plastic mess.

The Madagascar boat ride is one of the most boring things ever and it just seemed so cheaply made. I know they could have done that better.

I'm not trying to be a hater trust me I really wanted to enjoy myself but with tiny water bottles at 3.50 and the rides being completely lack luster, my hope is that the park owners will spend some money into making this experience a bit more lively.

The donkey show was advertised as a comedy show but I warn you it wasn't and the funniest part was the poor guy who was hosting it. It's also just a cartoon so it's not donkey live like they say. The kids seemed to be ok with it but everyone else around us seemed to be sorely disappointed judging by their faces.

Многочисленные магазины с товарами, варьирующимися от золота и драгоценностей до специй и традиционной индийской одежды сари, соревнуются друг с другом за покупателей. 
Словно сошедший с иллюстраций к фантастическим романам, отель «Марина Бей Сандс» настолько гармонично вписался в урбанистические пейзажи Сингапура, словно он появился одновременно с городом и всегда возвышался на этом месте. Эта диковинная чудо-махина напоминает корабль.
Океанариум на Сентозе — уникальная возможность узнать побольше о подводном мире Сингапура. Здесь все сделано таким образом, чтобы вызвать максимальный интерес у посетителей.
Парк Мерлиона, раскинувшийся в устье реки Сингапур, — это не просто рядовое место для прогулок и отдыха, благодаря умелому пиару слава о нём разнеслась по всему миру. Сейчас парк можно смело назвать знаковой достопримечательностью Сингапура.
Открывает список самых-самых развлечений Сингапура, конечно же, волшебный парк развлечений Universal Studios, который расположен на территории комплекса Resorts World Sentosa, что на острове Сентоза. 
Сингапурский зоопарк считается одним из самых лучших зоопарков во всем мире. Причем как по уровню комфортности для животных, так и для посетителей. Главная особенность и гордость этого зоопарка в том, что все животные здесь содержаться в условиях максимально приближенных к естественной среде обитания. 
Арабский район или Кампонг-Глам считается самым маленьким в Сингапуре. Он представляет из себя несколько улиц, сконцентрированных вокруг главной местной достопримечательности — мечети Султана.
Гигантское колесо обозрения в Сингапуре (Singapore Flyer) в 2008 году аж на 30 метров переплюнуло знаменитый «Лондонский глаз». Самая высокая точка — 165 метров; понять, что вы находитесь именно там очень легко, вас поздравит с пребыванием на нужной высоте само колесо.
Сингапурский музей оптических иллюзий — филиал одноименного музея, расположенного в Сеуле. Музей оптических иллюзий (Trick Eye Museum) открыл свои двери для посетителей на территории отеля Resorts World Sentosa. Площадь музея составляет примерно 800 квадратных метров.
Достопримечательности Сингапура, государства, символом которого является полулев-полурусалка, привлекают многочисленных поклонников азиатского колорита, тропической природы и разного рода «чудес», наглядно демонстрирующих всю силу и мощь бывших британских колоний. Большая часть городских легенд, окутавших видоизмененное в 70-х годах лицо Сингапура, были созданы не так давно, однако от этого узнавать о них не менее интересно. На фоне тесного переплетения культур, выражающегося, прежде всего, в одновременном существовании разных религий, особенно выигрышно смотрятся огромные небоскребы, как будто символизирующие стремление жителей города к новым и новым высотам.

Пожалуй, одни из главных достопримечательностей города-государства — четыре квартала, в которых проживают разные этносы. Чайна-таун или китайский квартал, район Маленькая Индия, Арабский квартал и Малайская деревня интересны своим национальным колоритом и разнообразием религиозной архитектуры. Также тут можно приобрести сувениры и вкусно пообедать.

I used the chance to be in Singapore, to visit Universal Studios on Sentosa Island. The attractions are very nice, of high quality and the territory is not as big as in Florida or in Los Angeles or in Paris. The disturbing thing was more the huge number of people all around, with queues reaching easily 80-90 minutes for some attractions like battlestar galactica or transformers... I don't like to queue as it is a huge loss if time, of energy, with not always nice smelling people all around you and a lot of noise too... So if you can afford it, take the fast line ticket at 30 Singapore dollars ! 
During the day, some thunderstorms were coming above Universal Studios, so all attractions were suddenly stopped ! Meaning that if you were queuing for 45 minutes, then you lost your time for nothing...
Better to be at 10:00am ready to start the first big attractions in order to avoid the crowd, and to finish peacefully with more quite ones. I will soon add some photos for you to see what I'm talking about. For sure, go when the weather is good, if not, you will loose a lot of your time waiting...

Ein Tageseintritt kostet 76.-- SGD, wobei dieser für einen Aufpreis von 22.-- SGD in einen Saisonpass gültig für 6 Monate umwandeln lässt. Wer mehr als einmal hier hin will, sollte dieses Angebot unbedingt nutzen. Für weitere 100.-- SGD kann man die Saisonkarte mit unbeschränktem Express Pass haben.

Wer Themenparks und rasante Achterbahnen mag, kommt hier auf seine Kosten. Was ich allerdings etwas Schade finde, ist die Tatsache, dass die Universal Studios vom ursprünglichen Konzept einen Einblick in die Filmbranche zu erhalten fast vollends abgekommen ist.

We started around 10 a.m but recommended 9.45am because there may be long queues. Recommended getting the tickets online before comes to the park.

If you are travelling with children, one to watch out is the height. Some of the attraction may need recommended height. The park is separated into sections and there are lots of attractions like Transformers, Revenge of mummy, Jurassic Park, Bullet Rollercoasters [Galactica: Human and Cylon], Water world show, 4D shows (Shrek). Madagascar, Puss in Boots, Live movie etc. You can see some live shows also.

The one to watch is the Transformers and may expect a long queue. One of the things you can do is [1] to get the express pass [2] or you can cover the less waiting time attractions first and then go for others when the waiting time reduces.

If you get Express Unlimited then you can go for multiple rides as much as you want.

2,583161380,2018-05-27,MOBILE,5,"It was simply an amazong experience for us and our little kids. 
Although we went on a Sunday, the park was not too crowded. It could be due to the wet weather in the morning that deterred visitors.
My toddlers aged 2 & 3 enjoyed the Madagascar boat ride and the Spaghetti Spaceball ride. It was very child friendly. Wait times for these rides were abt 5 to 15mins.
We especially enjoyed the WaterWorld show and all its effects. That would be the one show I would recommend everyone to watch - but stay out of the splash zone seating area if you do not wish to get soaked.
We also caught the special effects show by steven spielberg but found it very disappointing. We expected to feel some kind of wind force comparable to a simulated hurricane but it felt more like a fan that was trying its best to run at full speed when the power was dying out.
Food and drinks were aplenty at extremely inflated prices ($4 for a can of Fanta compared to $1.80 outside). Merchandise, though, were fairly priced.
The toilets were plenty around with a diaper change station right outside the Ladies. As a thought perhaps separate diaper changing rooms would be appreciated OR position one outside both male & female toilets (ny husband felt awkward standing outside the ladies to change my younger one's nappy while i took my older one in to use the toilet).

The wait time was usually 5 minutes up to a max of 15 minutes which was excellent.
It did pick up later in the afternoon and the “adult” rides seen a longer line up to 60 minutes.
We bucked trend and went to the left first jumping straight on the Madagascar ride & Shrek roller coaster.
The Jurassic Park area opened later at 11am but once opened the wait times were minimal.
Between us we did every ride in the Park but our favourite ride of the day (for all of us) was the Transformers ride, that was awesome. Our daughter went on too and loved it but not every child would, the 3D effects are full on!
Be quick for the meet & greets the spots fill up quickly and we missed out on a couple.
The photo opportunity for the Madagascar crew was hectic and not well organised, if you line up make sure you line up directly behind an attendant not where the host tells you to, our entire line nearly missed out due to this.
The Waterworld show is spectacular and definitely worth seeing but we got caught in the crowd in the sweltering heat for 30 minutes+ waiting for the gates to open, this was unnecessary as when the gates finally opened and the show began there was still plenty of available seats.
Shopping was good and well priced and plenty of food options available although as expected is not cheap, but there are well priced items to be found if you go looking.
It is disappointing that there is no parades during the week but the smaller crowds made up for it.
The location is easy, walkable distance if staying on Sentosa which is great after a long day or otherwise is really close to a station, HarbourFront I think.

My recommendation is for the park to offer an express pass for say about 5 rides at a lower price than the standard one. I would have paid for that but not the standard one as we would not have got the value. Other than that food is the usual expensive theme park food - I was desperate for something healthy after.  We didn't see any characters wandering about and shows seemed limited. Haven't been to Disney but would hope they have more.

5,580755997,2018-05-16,MOBILE,4,"Stayed for a week in Singapore so had to check out their Universal Studios. 

We bought our tickets online in a bundle with the Sentosa cable car as it saves you money at the gate with cheaper prices. Plus you can skip the que out front to get in! Both passes had a month to use so we bought them in Australia before we even started our holiday. Take a screen shot of the booking email incase you don’t have internet or international roaming on. 

Arrived shortly after opening and was super busy. We went to transformers ride first and waited over an hour and a half for the ride. After that wait we decided to buy an express ride pass which are available from most of the info kiosks or merch shops. This meant we could jump the ride que for an extra roughly $40 each per person. Considering the busy lines it was well worth the expense! Wait time dropped down to no more than 3-5minutes and we definitely got our money’s worth. 
Transformers ride was definitely a fave and waterworks show was fun as well! Make sure to sit up high if you don’t want to get wet as there are lots of explosions and pyrotechnics with water spraying all over the audience. 
Jurassic Park ride also was a water ride and your bound to get wet pants spinning round on their floats! Having cool pants on a hot day though was fine and they dry quickly.

Food was usual amusement park prices and we bought our own drink bottles so saved cash there but filling them up. Would recommend sunscreen or hats as walking between the rides in the hot sun got us a little sunburnt. 

By about 2pm-3pm the park was much more quiet. Ride lines dropped dramatically and you could almost walk straight into rides.

We still struggled to see everything in a day and skipped a few of the smaller rides. 
I wouldn’t recommend doing the cable car in the same day as it would be too rushed.
We left at dusk when they were closing the park. Could have easily spent a second day enjoying more rides and taking photos and seeing everything we missed. 

Only thing I’d fault is a lot of their shows are on at the same time in different locations of the park so you have to choose between which one to see and then for back to back shows having to rush from one side of the park to the other to see something made us feel a little rushed. 
I’d recommend 1 day if you are just doing rides and maybe 2 days if you want to experience all Universal has to offer 

We came back a couple of days later for the cable car rides and spent some time on the beach at Sentosa and walked down to check out the Merlion which I was happy we didn’t rush on our universal day.

Overall a fun day with lots of rides and things to keep you busy. Photo opportunities with characters as they walk around the park was nice.

Here is what I learnt coming here twice in 1 year: Make sure you arrive about 15mins before the opening time of 10am and queue (it is worth it!)-turn right heading straight to the Transformers Ride. After that, if your kids are tall enough head straight to both roller coasters. You need to put your belongings into lockers and have nothing in your pockets before you ride. If they look daunting and you had to pick one, I would go on Human (red). My 8 year old daughter didn't mind this one! Then move on to the Mummy. My daughter didn't want to go on this one so my husband took my son and I went on later as a single rider. Well worth it! It cut the wait time by about a third. By this time Jurassuc World should be opening- but rather than queuing you can go on the Puss and Boots ride and return. The Jurassic Ride is awesome (you will get wet but it cools you down and dries quickly!). Don't worry about ponchos. If the queue is long, I would skip the Madagascar Ride- very average!

Also, as you can use express pass once in each ride, hence if you are here at 10 AM you can do some rides using the normal ticket, and repeat them with express.

By afternoon 3-4 pm,even express pass would have 30 min waiting at all good rides.
Do watch the waterworld show that happens at 2PM and then at 5:30 PM.
Other recommendations:
- Transformers ride
- Revenge of the mummy
- Battlestar galactica roller coasters
- Jurassic park rapids ride (opens at 11 AM)

You may not be able to cover everything in a day even with express, but give your best shot.

Food can be a bit costly, try the Malaysian food court just outside the gate. Do get the stamp while going out.

1)Don't be there at the gate opening, come aroucnd 10:30-11.
2) Don't buy the $60photo package.
3) Don't expect to spend the most of the day riding. The 3/4 of the time at the USS you will spend in queue.
4) Don't miss the Waterworld show.

I have been to Singapore many times. But this is the first time I got a chance to take my daughter (8yo) to the USS. As another reviewer had recommended, I had bought the tickets on Klook in a package with the Flyer admission. We had arrived to the park at 9:45, waited in line to get in (it was extremely hot, so make sure you have a hat and/or umbrella to protect you from the sun. I would recommend to arrive to the park some time after the doors open, to avoid waiting in the line. We left the park at 7pm, but only got a chance to get 3 rollercoaster rides and attend 3 shows.  Most of the day we spent roaming around the USS trying to find a ride that has less than 45 minutes wait.The moat popular rides have 50 minutes + waiting time ( at 1 point there was 120 minutes wait). So very dissapointed. We got tired for nothing. The rides that we got a chnace to ride are too short. So we had spent 30 minutes in line to have a 2 minutes ride.
Avoid the donkey show, it is pathetic. 4D Shrek movie was not bad. The Waterworld show is a must see. 
At the entrance to the USS they offer you a photo deal od S $60 which includes 1 photo printed + all your photos taken in the park available online. Don't expect that there will be a fotografer waiting to take your photo at every attraction. In fact, you  can only see them at the entrance and at certain times when there is a meet and greet time with some characters. And even on some rides where the foto is supposed to be taken, the camera was broken.

On exiting the weather had cleared so we queued up for the puss in boots ride (40 minutes)This time we were lucky because as we exited and looked up at the sky another storm was on it's way.

Nevertheless, most of the entertaining rides, mummy, transformer, etc are all here..couple of good roller coasters as well, which i do not recollect at the LA one..

Advice would be to get express pass(in advance) if possible..weekends r really crowded and wait times can go upto an hour at peak times..I bought it a month in advance n cost 50 sgd for the unlimited option(was 30 for regular express) per person..yes, expensive but worth it..risk, of course is the rain..they shut down the open rides at slightest hint of rain n express pass is not open dated..luckily, for us, it didnt rain till late afternoon..

Also note that few rides r not covered under express pass, so do them first thing u reach there..ex treasure hunter, a hit with toddlers n young kids can have wait times upto an hour

Food is overpriced but guess thats the issue anyway with such theme parks..carry water(or empty bottles) that u can refill inside..lots of walking to do n can b tough with young kids on a sunny day..

The Shrek movie theatre ride had 25 mins wait so went there. This is a movie theatre 4d 'ride’. Everyone told (in English & Chinese) beforehand not to rush to seats.

To my surprise, other than fast racing rides, there are so many interesting and fun activities at USS. The weather was extremely hot, and the food and drinks sold at USS were so exorbitant. In addition, what is the most important is the queue. We went on Thursday and the period was not a public/school holiday, thus the queue was very manageable. For those fast rides, the waiting time was about 20 minutes and quite a number of queues took us only 5 minutes. There were 2-3 exceptional one where we took about 35-40 minutes to enter. In overall, if you want to enjoy to the max, please visit during weekdays which do not fall under public/school holidays.

The environment was great and the architecture of each building was unique, so please don't forget to charge your camera/phone to full bar for amazing photo shooting! We two took so many photos wherever we went to. Also, the amenities at USS are considered complete and good too.

Despite fast and challenging rides, the activities are quite kids friendly, and fine for someone like me (who can't take rides at all) to play as well.

If you want to do the Transformer rollercoasters, you will need to take off everything loose on you, (EG: bem bags, cameras, phones, sunnies wallets, etc) as they will not let you ride with these. Staff will wand you before going on the ride. There are lockers located next to the 2 rides, so you can store your stuff in there.

The shows are pretty good. The waterworld one is entertaining but starting to look a bit dated. Its basically the same show they have at every other Universial Theme Park.

I would plan your day ahead as the rides soon get very busy and wait times get long. Do a lot ofyour rides early.

Whilst I was waiting to go on the Jurassic Park Ride, the single rider line was closed. Yet, people were still entering and cutting to the front of the queue saying they were single riders. Staff then mentioned that the single rider line was closed, yet tourists were still entering and staff were not telling them to go to the back of the line. I had waitied 45 mins to go on this ride, and I reckon there was still a 10-15 min wait. Only when I approached staff and told them what was going on, did they do anything, other than going on the loudspeaker to tell people that the line was closed. I told them it wasnt fair to others that were waiting and that instead of  allowing these people to ride, they should be sent to the back of the line, as it wasnt fair to the rest of the people waiting, and especially me, as I was a single rider. These people pushing  in really need to be sent to the back tof the line and the management should be enforcing this more.

However the day seems less to do justice to the theme park. The park is beautifully  themed on Hollywood movies. The thrilling rides were - transformers, sci- fi city, the mummy , the lost world. All are based on rollar coasters with movie scenes themed for effects and thrills. The waterworld show was a treat to watch with good drama by the actors and pyrotecnics keeping you an the edge of your seats throughtout. Apart from this there were many other shows to entertain the crowd of vivid spectrum.
Few tips - in case you want to do the entire rides in a day express pass is the key. 
Generally  30 to 40 min wait is standard for exciting rides so choose carefully initially. You can give shows other than waterworld a miss to cover the rides. Carry water as it gets hot and humid.

The highlights of the theme park were the Battle Star Galactica rides -  Cylon and Human. Special mention to Cylon, which is just an awesome high-speed rollercoaster and the main attraction with the longest waiting times at the theme park. 

Other ride highlights included The Mummy, Transformers and Puss in Boots Journey.

The queues on the rides are long and waiting time can be up to an hour +. We bought the unlimited Fast Pass, which while is very costly for a family of 5, however, it was money well spent and resulted in an average waiting time of ~ 15 minutes for the major attractions.

3,571865520,2018-04-08,OTHER,4,"Went to Universal Studios with the family in April. My kids love theme parks and thus when looking at tickets we noted a season pass for less then a 2 day pass - thus purchased that ticket. Therefore we did not go for the fast pass. In saying that if you are just going for 1 day - get the fast pass - the wait times are crazy. The Park is not massive and with only 3 or 4 BIG rides the key is to get in the park as early as possible. After an hour the wait times are 80 mins plus. Thus a few thoughts:
- Get there early - they open the outer gates at 9.30am so you can get to the front of the turnstiles that open at 10am
- Consider going on a Friday or Saturday - the parked stayed open until 10pm - 3 hrs extra
- We went on a Saturday and without warning the park opened at 9.45am 
- By being in early we got to do all the major rides in the first hour (some of them multiple times)

The main reason for this review however is pass on a word of warning - we accidentally purchased 3x Singapore Resident tickets plus Unlimited Express passes online to a total of $366, upon realising the mistake (we were visiting from the UK) we phoned Universal expecting to be able to upgrade by paying the $6 extra per ticket but were told by a supervisor (via the operator, she wouldn't tell us direct!) that it was basically our bad luck & if we wanted to visit the park we would have to purchase new tickets (according to her on a follow up email that is company policy)...if we had taken her at her word we would have lost all that money!
As it turns out we went to the park the following morning & were told we could upgrade as you would expect, there was a lot of confusion about also printing out the Express Pass etc but ultimately it was sorted.

We were about fifth in line and when the gates did open we did the best rides in rapid time with hardly any waiting. 2 hours later when we were walking around they were all 60-80 min wait.

There are free lockers for 45 mins that are easy to use. Moved along to mummy returns - again only a 5 minute wait. Another decent ride. Went to the rapids to find it was closed. We then went on Madagascar for something to do - wished we hadn’t bothered.

There is an option to pay twice the amount for your ticket so you can get into express queues BUT! This only works if the tickets are rare and exclusive. It seemed like 1/4 of the people there had paid for the more expensive tickets knowing that it was going to be busy. So this meant that THEIR queues were also backing up. So when both lines were full it made those who had paid for a regular ticket feel like plebs because watching the express people get though over and over again and out queue not moving at all was incredibly frustrating. 
It wouldn’t encourage me to go back again.  It felt almost unfair.

This place is for all age.. i mean you will forget your age after checking-in. 

Its a round route trip like a donut. You will end where you have started. You need min 6 to 8 hrs to fully satisfy the child in you..

Tips: 
#1. The Water World show has timings. Check these timings. 7.30pm is the last show and better to see the lightning effects.

#2. Every one moves from right hand after entering the gate. Thus all the shows have long queue. We experienced a 1hr to 1:30hrs waiting time in the morning. Better move from left (  you will start with Far Far away) which is competitively less crowded. By evening, all the other attractions will get relaxed.

#3. Must see attractions top to bottom:
a. Sci-Fi City.. Transformer-the ride
b. Ancent Egypt
c. The lost world- Jurassic Park rapids & Woter world.
d. Rollercoaster ride in Sci-fi
e. Sesame Street show for kids

The tickets are cheaper if you buy through klook.com and you don't even have to wait in the que. You need to make an itenary to decide which rides you will do in which order so as to finish all rides on time. It is preferable that you reach by around 10 15- 10 30 because the park opens at 10 and at that time there is a lot of rush to go in. So by going 15-20 mins late, you can avoid the rush. However don't go later than that because then you won't have enough time to do all the rides. It is preferable to do the rollercoasters in the end because generally everybody rushes to do them first because it is the main attraction. So if you go in the end the wait time for the ride is much lesser. There are many rides which offer single rider i.e. there is a seperate que if you don't mind riding alone. You should split up your group and go in this as it saves a lot of time. Especially in rides where there are odd number of seats. This needs to be done especially in puss in the boots ride because per ride there are 3 places and the 3rd place is always free. It is preferable that you eat at the mall outside universal before entering because the food at universal is quite expensive. You can carry your own food as well.

Tip 1 is that you might need to spend a whole day if you want to try all of their activities.

Wear a decent summer clothes as it gets really hot durin the day, you can wear slippers too (as there are some rides where you can wet) 

We went there on a weekday but still the queues to the rides are long so you might want to spend more bucks to have the express pass (if you already have the regular pass, you just need to add 50 more SGD to have one time express pass and 80SGD for unlimited one). Note that some rides dont have express line so you have to wait but the most recommended rides do have so its ok.

I recommend you to watch Underwater show (it is amazing). The productions and the effects are great, the casts(actors) are amazing! Beware where to sit though coz you will be soaked and get realllyy wet if you will sit in front. Another show is Lights Show (if the name is correct), it is a show where you will see how a movie is being shot in a studio (there will be a surprise at the end so better prepare) 

Another great rides are The Jurasic Park, The Mummy, Transformers, The Human Roller Coasters which you may want to lastly ride. It is the most amazing and extreme ride!

However the price of food is ridiculously way over priced! A chicken burger combo with a pathetically small gathering of fries will set you back $15SGD, a whole pizza designed to feed a small family will just not make it at $50SGD.

1. Crowds clear out towards the end of the day. My son loved the Transformers ride, and the first time we stood in line for almost over an hour. Towards the end of the day, however, (from about 5pm onwards), the waiting time miraculously dropped down to 5 mins! We literally walked right up to the ride. The same went for most rides, except Battlestar Galetica and the Jurassic Park river rapids. Those were clearly crowd favourites. The Jurassic Park ride stayed at 30 mins even at the end of the day (7.30pm).

2. Single Riders go more quickly. Seems obvious enough, really. If you don't mind sitting with other people, you get a much shorter wait time. 

3. Food is cheaper and tastier outside the park. There are tons of eateries outside the park. Get a stamp on your hand, run out and get some grub more cheaply. Some of it is tastier too. 

4. Lights, Camera, Action! is better than it seems. I thought it'd be a video about the magic of movies. Turns out it was an actual experience. Worth checking out.

were quick to get rid of you, not smiling and some were not friendly. I believe training/re training is needed, maybe improve their facilities, make them happy so they in turn can project this in the work they do.

紅色過山車有在維修所以正好滿意坐到了藍色的。同樣排隊等候並不貼心，不允許旅客攜帶易落物品如眼鏡、手機、書包等的確無錯，但排隊等待40分鐘無手機我真的太無聊了。而且只有我一個人排隊，等得眼都要合上了。

Parken har 3 olika entrepaket. Vanlig entre, fast pass och unlimited (kan ha fel på namnen). 
Entre innebär att man står i ""vanlig"" kö - i vårt fall mellan 30-70 minuter när detgär som mest folk i parken
Fast pass innebär att man får gå i en speciell kö (5-10 min väntan), men detta får man bara göra en gång per attaktion.
Unlimited kostar dubbelt så mycket som entren men ger fri tillgång till den snabba kön. 
Vi investerade i unlimited (tänk på att skriva ut dessa) vilket gav oss en fantastisk dag! Vid öppning och en timme framåt samt innan stängning var det inte så mycket folk men däremellan - massor! Att bara behöva vänta 5 minuter per attraktion var en nödvändighet! Våra barn åkte själv i ganska stor utsträckning (finns längdskalor för de stora berg- och dalbanorna) vilket de uppskattade.
Då det är fuktigt i Singapore rekommenderas att ta med vattenflaskor in i parken. Det finns en hel del ställen där man kan fylla dessa med dricksvatten! Parken är ganska dyr på mat så ta gärna med bananer/snacks som mellanmål om ni vill spara pengar.

Things to do: buy tickets at the official website for senstosa island for the universal studios. The pass is valid for 30-60 days. Buy online from your home country to avoid additional charges for card payment. This is the best deal.
Take the express pass without fail to have a good experience.
All rides will have long queues on all days. Express pass will enable you to cut through it. Without express you will spend minimum of 30 min. The wait can go upto 2.5 HRs per ride on bad days.

The rides at USS are more for teens and above. There are still a couple of rides that the young children can go but is not as exciting though.

Transformer: Great 4D, I think it's really well built and interesting
The mummy: I like it also, full of surprise
Jurassic Park: Well, it's made for fun and you'll get wet a little but they sell a poncho for 5$ if you want to use it (I don't use it, and I'm quite okay with that). It's a bit different from another water ride, and I admire the design.

Also be sure to have cash in hand as the lockers do not provide any change (ex. You want to use the locker for an hour for $4 when you have only $5 in cash, but they won't give you $1 back). I haven't been to Universal Studios in other countries, but I was quite surprised by this system (spending more than I had planned, obviously).  Overall, though, the USS was awesome in terms of rides, shows, and service.

2. Под проливным тропическим ливнем заставляли снимать дождевики, не объясняя причин, даже на ""сухих"" горках.
3. Перегораживали трассы для ожидания так, что вместо того, чтобы стоять под навесом, защищающем от солнца или ливня, люди (в основном все с детьми!) стояли под открытым небом.

MUST have : wear comfortable cloth lesser the better. flip-flop will be handy as you will be roaming for the whole day, sunscreen, shades.Singapore is hot.

Tips to save money: Take MRT till harbour front and 15min walk till universal (save entrance fee.Carry your water bottle/drinks and food (didn't see anyone check the bag ) or go out of the gate(its allowed to reenter )  ... have food or beer from 711 .
Few rides will you will get you wet (soaked ).Inside raincoat will be charge 5 SGD  Get rainwear from city cost 0.50cents.Plus it comes handy if it rains as in SIN its unpredictable.
Also, one of the ride in lost world ,ask you to keep belonging inside the locker (chargeable ).so be little cheeky ,goto locker next to MUMMY ride which have free locker (55min free ) ...kaachinnnggg!!! Also , visit Water world to see live stunts (only two shows so ask for it ).

1,564460308,2018-03-04,OTHER,4,"I'd suggest people to come early to buy tickets, as there would be queue, especially in the weekend, AND for the time-saver get either the unlimited or the normal express pass (this is an additional charge on top of the entrance ticket.) We paid SG$70 per person (children have to pay too) for the normal express pass, which let us go ONCE on the express lane for almost all the rides and shows in the park. It saved a lot of time for us as we went on Saturday. We got to play most of the rides and only had to queue when we wanted to go on the second time, which mean that we really liked that ride and would be happy to queue for it!
The unlimited express pass will let you go on the express lane unlimitedly as the name suggests, but it's almost twice more costly than the normal express pass, I think.

The rides and shows are great. The restrooms are clean. The food halls are cleaned quickly by the staffs, and, though, the choices in the food hall (we went to the one in Jurassic Park area), is not many, but they have vegetarian option and the portion is quite good, which is great.

We stayed until 8pm to watch the fireworks and we managed to ride a couple of rides though the park was closed at 7pm. There were no queue and it was great!
The highlights for us where the Transformer ride, seeing Bumble bee & Optimus Prime and going on the human vs. Cyborg roller coaster (the human one, Cyborg one was too scary :p)

If you love rides loads of choice with alien Galactica rollercoaster a must do.

However if not so brave some good gentle rides and amazing shows! Be it inside a theatre to out on the streets some amazing shows. 

Tip ** To make most of park arrive at least 30 minutes before opening or if weekend arrive 45 minutes. Also pre pay tickets online easier if not one person go get tickets for group(if a group) whilst others wait in line. Closer to front you may have chance to win fast passes if have kids take with you as much higher chance and scream when demanded!! But we didn’t bother and if arrive early enough will not need fast passes. Just skip Transformers first do rest of park. Best time to go on transformers is jump in que When the parade is about to begin or finish a lot more shorter or do as last ride if staying late but we arrived 30 minutes before entry and was done by 5pm and that was around Chinese New Years and a Saturday so bit of planning goes far. 

Food wise we had a pizza near transformers and Elmo street was delicious and do great deals.

Overall rides are fantastic, perfect chill day with a lot of entertainment.

Staff wore friendly and entertaining and always allowed you to sit where wanted.

Madagascar have Fanta frozen smoothies what wore delicious and really cooled us down. 

Merchandise is best and some bits of park have exclusive to that area only like Jurassic Park.

I have an annual pass for Disneyland (USA), having also been to DisneyWorld, Tokyo Disney, HK Disney, and Universal Studios in Hollywood (which I do not really care much for).  I was quite pleased by the size, diversity, and design of this park. Despite the lack of a Harry Potter world, this park really does offer a full day of rides and attraction. We opted for the Express Pass (1 visit per ride) since we wanted to see do some exploring in SG at the end of the day, instead of wasting a whole day waiting in lines. Despite the online crowd calendar estimating a slow day, it was actually quite busy (Friday 1 week before Chinese New Year).  The Express Pass worked out quite well at minimizing waits, enabling us to ride almost everything and get out by 4:30 PM. 

They are very strict about not bringing anything loose (hats, cameras, phones, etc) onto the roller coasters (they even have a metal detector at the entrance to the line). I have not seen this before, but they do offer free short-term lockers (and SG is well-known for being a no-nonsense sort of place).  The food selection inside the park is actually quite good (also as expected in Singapore). Even better, there is a Malaysian Street Food Court just outside the main entrance that recreates Malaysian street food vendors with very low prices and plenty of indoor seating. Access to the park is easy, since it is inside of the Resorts World Sentosa complex (trains, taxis, and even a cable car). 

I am a big fan of dark rides, so the Sesame Street spaghetti monster ride was definitely my favorite. The Mummy ride is much better than the one in Hollywood, and the Cylon roller coaster is much more intense and enjoyable than Human (which was a bit underwhelming). The Treasure Hunter ride is not nearly as exciting as it sounds, and they disabled the express pass for it.

For kids enchanted airways, puss in boots and madagascar is must. If your kid is more than 110 cm tall you can them to transformers ride as well. We went to Elmo's TV time as well which is really good for all ages. Its like a musical. Donkey live is also good. Sesame street is also good but I would say do it towards the end of the day when the queue is short because its not worth the long queue. Take the tickets from the airport itself. That will save some time.
To reach to Universal take a train to Harbourfront and then Vivocity, Ask someone for bus that goes to sentosa and take that bus (RW8) to sentosa which charges 1 SGD per person and is the cheapest way of transport to reach sentosa.",A place for everyone,2018-02-01,FAMILY,sumitprat,"Mumbai, India",Mumbai,India,1

Universal studios Singapore มีต้นกำเนิดมาจาก Hollywood และ Orlando ในประเทศอเมริกา หลังจากที่ประสบความสำเร็จในการเข้ามาเปิดในแถบเอเชีย ประเทศแรกคือ ญี่ปุ่น ตอนนั้นเป็นสิ่งที่ชาวเอเชียตื่นตาตื่นใจมาก จัดเป็นสวนสนุกในเครือบริษัท Universal park and resort ที่ได้เปิดสวนสนุกในรัฐฟลอริดาและแคลิฟอร์เนียของสหรัฐ รวมถึงญี่ปุ่น ในสวนสนุกนี้ มีเครื่องเล่นทั้งหมด 24 ชนิด เป็นเครื่องเล่นที่ออกแบบใหม่จำนวน 18 ชนิด เพิ่งเปิดไปเมื่อปี 2010 สวนสนุกแห่งนี้ดึงนักท่องเที่ยวมาเที่ยวสิงคโปร์ได้มากจริง เราก็มาเพราะสิ่งนี้เช่นกัน เพราะเป็น Universal Studios แห่งที่สองของเอเชียที่เป็นสวนสนุกระดับ world class แห่งแรกอยู่ที่ประเทศญี่ปุ่น สำหรับการเที่ยว Universal Studio และเกาะ Sentosa ควรมีเวลาอย่างน้อย 1 วัน เพราะบนเกาะมีที่เที่ยวหลายจุด แต่ถ้ามีเวลา 2 วันก็จะเที่ยวได้ทั่วเกาะ

บัตร Universal Studios Singapore วันธรรมดาอยู่ที่ราคา 66 SGD วันหยุดราคา 72 SGD สามารถซื้อหน���างาน หรือ ซื้อกับเอเจนซี่ Sea Wheel Travel ย่าน Chinatown สิงคโปร์ ราคาค่อนข้างถูก เราซื้อได้ราคา 62 SGD เอง ถูกกว่าราคาที่ขายที่ไทยอีก พนักงานก็เป็นคนไทย บัตรมีอายุการใช้งานได้ 1 ปี เมื่อซื้อไปแล้วสามารถเล่นเครื่องเล่นได้ทุกอย่างใน Universal Studio ไม่ต้องจ่ายเงินเพิ่ม สำหรับผู้ที่ซื้อตั๋ว Online เค้าจะส่งตั๋วมาให้ทาง e-mail ให้นำไป print แล้วนำไปใช้ได้เลย ไม่ต้องไปแลกเป็นตั๋วอีกที
วันเสาร์-อาทิตย์ จะมีนักท่องเที่ยวมาเที่ยวมาก เครื่องเล่นบางอย่างต้องรอคิวนาน แต่ถ้าไม่อยากรอคิว นอกเหนือจากบัตรเข้าชมแล้ว ให้ซื้อ Express Pass อีก 30 SGD เครื่องเล่นทุกชนิด และการแสดงทุกอย่างจะมีแถวExpress Pass ซึ่งคิวจะสั้นกว่าแถวปกติมากๆ แต่ถ้ามาวันธรรมดาไม่ต้องซื้อ Express Pass ไม่คุ้ม เรามาวันธรรมดา คนไม่มากเท่าไหร่

การเดินทางมา Universal Studios Singapore และเกาะ Sentosa
ให้นั่งรถไฟฟ้ามาลงที่สถานี HarbourFront (สุดสาย สายสีม่วง North East Line) สามารถเดินทางได้ 4 วิธี
1. Sentosa Express เป็นวิธีที่สะดวกและได้รับความนิยมมากที่สุด จากสถานี Harbour Front ให้เดินมาที่ห้าง Vivo City ขึ้นไปที่ชั้น 3 ของห้าง ที่สถานี Sentosa จะมีรถไฟฟ้าวิ่งไปยังเกาะ Sentosa เสียค่าใช้จ่ายคนละ 4 SGD ถ้ามี EZ link อยู่แล้วก็แตะผ่านเข้าไปเลย หรือจะซื้อบัตรโดยสารราคา 4 SGD ที่ตู้ก็ได้ ที่จริงคือจ่ายค่าไปอย่างเดียวแต่กลับฟรี ไปมาเร็วมาก บนเกาะ Sentosa จะมีสถานีรถไฟฟ้า (Sentosa Express) อยู่ 3 สถานีสั้นๆ เราสามารถนั่งมาไหน ไปไหนได้หมด โดยที่ไม่ต้องเสียค่าโดยสารอีกแล้ว แต่ที่จริง ไม่ไกลกันมาก สามารถเดินได้ทั่วเกาะถ้ามีเวลา
เส้นทางรถไฟฟ้า (Vivo City ชั้นสาม) <–> Waterfront Station <–> Imbiah Station <–> Beach Station
สถานี Waterfront Station เป็นที่ตั้งของสวนสนุก Universal Studios Singapore, Water cove park, Sea aquarium และ Casino เสียดายตอนไปอยากไป Water cove park แต่ปิด เพราะล้างครั้งใหญ่
สถานี Imbiah Station เป็นที่ตั้งของ Merlion Park หรือ Merlion ตัวพ่อ เป็น Merlion ที่ใหญ่ที่สุดในสิงคโปร์ และ Imbiah outlook วันที่ไปมีการแสดง Wing of Time แต่ไม่ได้เข้าชม เพราะเหนื่อย
สถานี Beach Station เป็นที่ตั้งของชายหาดต่างๆ เช่น Siloso, Palawan, Tanjong และเป็นที่แสดง Song of the Sea นอกจากนี้ยังมีป้อมปืนใหญ่ (Fort Siloso) ในสมัยสงครามโลกครั้งที่ 2 เปิดเป็นพิพิธภัณฑ์ปืน ต้องเสียค่าเข้าชม แต่เราไม่ได้ไป
2. Cable car กระเช้าลอยฟ้า เหมาะสำหรับผู้ไม่กลัวความสูง วิวด้านบนจะมองเห็นฝั่งสิงคโปร์ได้ชัดเจน คนไม่ค่อยนิยมเท่าไหร่ เพราะแพง เราไปวันธรรมดา ไม่เจอใครที่เดินทางด้วย Cable car เลย
3. Sentosa Bus เป็นรถเมล์ที่วิ่งระหว่าง Habour front ไปยังเกาะ Sentosa ค่าไป 1 SGD ลงที่ casino และที่เดียวกันรอรถเมล์สาย 1 2 3 ได้เลยขึ้นกับว่าจะไปที่ไหน
4. Boardwalk ทางเดินเท้า เสียค่าผ่านเพียง 1 SGD เป็นทางเลื่อนอัตโนมัติ และต้องเดินเองเป็นช่วงๆ ระหว่างทางจะเห็นวิวทะเลสวยงาม
ไม่ว่าจะเดินทางมา Sentosa ด้วยวิธีไหน เราสามารถใช้บริการ Sentasa Express, Bus ได้ฟรีตลอดที่อยู่บนเกาะ
ร้านอาหารที่ Vivo city จะถูกกว่าที่เกาะ Sentosa ควรกินก่อนไป เพราะวันไปจะเหนื่อยมาก
Universal Studios จะเปิดเวลา 10.00 –19.00 น.
เครื่องเล่นและการแสดงโชว์ ใน Universal Studios มีอยู่หลายอย่าง เราดูรอบโชว์ในใบที่เค้าแจกให้ที่ทางเข้า รอบโชว์ในแต่ละวันบางทีก็เปลี่ยนแปลงได้ จะมีใบแจ้งมา
ลักษณะการเดินใน Universal Studios จะเป็นการเดินเป็นวง ตามเข็มนาฬิกาหรือทวนก็ได้ โซนแรกที่เจอจะเป็นโซน Hollywood เสมือนเป็นหน้างาน ไม่ได้มีเครื่องเล่นอะไร แต่ก็จัดได้สวยงาม น่าถ่ายรูปเป็นที่ระลึก
ก่อนเข้าชมด้านใน เราก็ดูแผนที่คร่าวๆ และรอบการแสดงของแต่ละโชว์ไว้ก่อน ว่าโซนอะไรอยู่ตรงไหนบ้าง ตอนกี่โมง จะได้วางแผนถูก ตอนที่ไปเน้นเล่นเครื่องเล่นมากกว่าการดูการแสดง
Hollywood
โซนนี้เป็นโซนแรกใน Universal Studios จะเป็นร้านค้า ร้านขายของที่ระลึก ร้านอาหาร จำลองบรรยากาศของตึกต่างๆ แบบ Hollywood เน้นถ่ายรูป เราไปถ่ายรูปพอเป็นพิธีว่าได้มา แล้วรีบเดินต่อ เพราะอยากมาเล่น adventure มากกว่า
Pantages Hollywood Theater เป็นโรงละครเวที จุคนได้ถึง 1,500 คน วันที่ไปมีละครเวทีบรอดเวย์เรื่อง Monster Rock ลักษณะการแสดงจะเป็นละครสลับการการเต้น และการร้องเพลงแนว Rock ‘n Rool มีเอฟเฟคประกอบด้วย นักแสดงแต่งชุดแบบผีฝรั่ง? ใช้เวลาประมาณ 40-50 นาที ไม่มีแนว adventure
Universal Studios Store เป็นร้านขายของหลายอย่าง ของ Universal Studios เช่นของเล่น, เสื้อผ้า ราคาของในนี้แพง

? เทคนิคที่ทำให้เล่นเครื่องเล่นได้เร็วขึ้น ไม่ต้องต่อแถวนาน เกือบทุกเครื่องเล่นจะมีแถว Single Rider สำหรับคนที่มาคนเดียว หรือไม่จำเป็นจะต้องนั่งคู่กับใคร โดยปกติแล้วเมื่อเครื่องเล่นมา เค้าจะจัดคนแถวหลักเข้าไปนั่ง แล้วเหลือเศษ 1 เค้าก็เอาแถวของ Single Rider เข้าไปเติมเต็ม และแถว Single Rider คนจะมีน้อยมากหรือไม่มีเลย ทำให้ได้เล่นเครื่องเล่นเร็วกว่าแถวปกติ
? ใครที่หอบของไป แล้วอยากจะเล่นเครื่อง กลัวว่าจะไม่สะดวก เค้ามีที่ให้ฝากของด้วยครับ เป็นล๊อคเกอร์สีเหลือง มีอยู่ทุกโซน วิธีใช้ตู้ล๊อคเกอร์ กรแกข้อมูลตามหน้าจอ ง่ายมาก แล้วจำเวลาที่ฝากได้ฟรีว่ากี่นาที เกินกว่านั้นก็เสียเงินตามเวลาที่เกิน ตู้ล๊อคเกอร์นี้ไม่ทอนเงิน พยายามหยอดเงินให้พอดี
Madagascar
โซนนี้มาจากการ์ตูนเรื่อง Madagascar ร่วมผจญภัยไปกับ Alex และ Marty เครื่องเล่นในโซนนี้จะเหมาะกับเด็ก ไม่น่ากลัว ไม่ผาดโผน มีความเป็นเทพนิยาย
เครื่องเล่นในโซนนี้ Madagascar : A Creat Adventure ล่องเรือไปกับ Alex, Marty, Melman และ Gloria เราจะต้องนั่งในเรือลำนึงก็ประมาณ 20-30 คน เรือก็จะไหลไปตามทางน้ำไหล ผ่านผืนป่ามาดากาสการ์ ในหนังภาคที่ 1 ข้างในสว่าง มีหุ่นขยับได้เป็นระยะ แต่แอบไม่ค่อยสมจริง เหมาะสำหรับเด็กๆ แต่มีจุดหนึ่งที่สะดุดใจคือประตูน้ำ เป็นน้ำตกมาจริงๆ ตอนแรกนึกว่าจะเปียกแล้ว แต่พอเรือผ่านกลับเปิดประตู หยุดปล่อยน้ำ จุดนี้ทำออกมาสวย
King Julien ‘s Beach Party-Go-Round ม้าหมุนสัตว์ชนิดต่างๆ ริมชายหาดจำลอง เหมือนจะเป็นของเล่นเด็กเล็ก แต่ผู้ใหญ่มาเล่นเหมือนกัน ไม่มีอะไรตื่นเต้น น่ารักดี
ในโซน Madagascar จะมีโชว์อยู่หนึ่งโชว์ ชื่อโชว์ Madagascar Boogie! จะเป็นตัวการ์ตูนในเรื่อง Madagascar มาเต้นในเพลง I like to move it, Move it พอเต้นเสร็จก็จะอยู่ให้เราถ่ายรูปต่อ ก็ดูน่ารักดี
Far Far Away
โซนนี้มีดีที่ ปราสาท Shrek ตัวปราสาทคล้ายกับที่ Disney land ภายในปราสาทเป็นโรงภาพยนตร์ 4 มิติ ทำออกมาสวยงามน่าประทับใจมาก
Shrek 4-D Adventure ชมหนัง 4 มิติเรื่อง Shrek ตอนแรกเราจะเข้าไปอยู่ในห้องแรก เล่าเรื่องโดยกระจกวิเศษ หมูสามตัวที่อยู่ในกล่อง ให้เรายืนฟัง เป็นการเกริ่นเรื่อง อาจจะไม่ค่อยสนุกเท่าไหร่ คนออกเยอะ แต่อย่างเพิ่งออกเลย พอเกริ่นเสร็จจะเข้าไปในส่วนโรงหนัง 4D
เนื้อเรื่องจะเป็นตอนที่เจ้าหญิง Fiona ถูกจับตัวไป แล้ว Shrek เข้าไปช่วย คนดูต้องสวมแว่นตาสามมิติด้วย เมื่อใส่แว่นแล้ว ภาพจะเหมือนยื่นมาใกล้ตัวเรา มิติที่ 4 ของหนังเรื่องนี้อยู่ที่เก้าอี้ขยับได้ ในฉากที่ Shrek ควบม้า เก้าอี้จะโยกตามไปด้วย มีลมพัดมาจริง มีละอองน้ำ ทำให้เหมือนอยู่ในเหตุการณ์จริง สนุกดี 4 มิติสมจริง
Enchanted Airways เป็นรถไฟเหาะที่มีหัวเป็นมังกร รางอยู่ไม่สูง แล่นไปเรื่อยๆ หวาดเสียวนิดหน่อย เด็กและผู้ใหญ่ก็เล่นได้ มีเหวี่ยงอยู่จุดหนึ่ง แต่ก็ไม่มาก
The Lost World
Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure เครื่องเล่นนี้รอคิวนานมาก การเข้าแถว Single Rider Lane จะทำให้ได้เล่นเร็วขึ้น เครื่องเล่นนี้มีเปียก แต่เปียกไม่มาก บางคนใส่เสื้อกันฝนเตรียมไว้เลย หากไม่มีให้ซื้อเอาที่ทางเข้า ราคา 2 SGD เข้าไปด้านในจะเป็นทางน้ำให้ล่องแก่ง เข้าไปในดินแดน Jurassic Park มีไดโนเสาร์อยู่ 2 ข้างทาง เราจะอยู่บนเรือทรงกลมคล้ายถ้วย นั่งได้ 8 คน น้ำจะไหลพาเราไปเข้าถ้ำมืดๆ เจอไดโนเสาร์ ตกใจแล้วหนีออกมา แล้วตกด้านล่าง ตอนนี้น่าจะตื่นเต้นสุด แล้วแต่ดวงว่าฝั่งไหนจะเปียกมากกว่ากัน
Canopy Flyer เป็นที่นั่งแบบห้อยขา นั่งเป็นคู่ 2 คู่นั่งหันหลังชนกัน กระเช้าจะเคลื่อนที่ พาชมวิวในโซน The Lost World เลื่อนไปตามราง เหมาะสำหรับชมวิว เรากลัวความสูง เลยกลัวนิดๆ
WaterWorld เป็นการแสดงโชว์ Stunts เปิดแสดงเพียง 2 รอบต่อวัน คนมาดูเยอะมาก แนะนำให้ไปก่อนเวลาแสดง การแสดงนั้น มาจากหนังแอคชั่น ลงทุนสูง เรื่องหนึ่งของอเมริกา ที่พอฉายจริงกลับไม่ดัง ก่อนที่การแสดงจะเริ่ม สตั๊นแมน จะให้คนดูปรบมือ ทำคลื่นเวฟ พอไม่ได้อย่างใจก็สาดน้ำใส่คนดูซะเลย ทั้งตักจากถัง และเอากระบอกสูบมาฉีด ยิ่งใครกางร่มจะยิ่งเจอฉีดไม่ยั้ง
โซนที่นั่งของ WaterWorld จะแบ่งเป็นสี ต้องเลือกนั่งให้ดี
โซนสีฟ้า – เปียกแน่ๆ โซนสีเขียว – เปียกไม่มากแค่น้ำกระเด็น โซนสีน้ำตาล – ไม่เปียก
สังเกตว่าคนที่มาก่อนจะเลือกนั่งสีน้ำตาล 
การแสดงเริ่มขึ้นจากนางเอกที่ขับเรือเล็กออกมา นางเอกถูกจับตัว พระเอกก็ไปช่วย เนื้อเรื่องไม่สนุกนัก แต่เอฟเฟคทำดี การแสดงของนักแสดง + ฝีมือในการขับเรือ ยอมรับว่าเก่งมาก เอฟเฟค เสียงปืน ระเบิดก็ใส่กันเต็มที่ จังหวะที่เรือเจทสกีเลี้ยว ก็มีน้ำกระเด็นออกมาโดนคนดูบ้าง นิดหน่อย จะมีฉากตื่นเต้นอยู่ฉากนึงมีการปล่อยเครื่องบินตกลงมาที่น้ำ นางเอกในโชว์ชุดนี้ หุ่นล่ำ แสดงเก่งจริง มีโรยตัว ต่อสู้ โชว์ชุดนี้ใช้เวลาประมาณ 45 นาที
Ancient Egypt
บรรยากาศแบบอิยิปต์ โซนนี้มาจากหนังเรื่อง Mummy ทางเข้าโซนมีรูปปั้นสีดำ ซ้าย – ขวาเป็น guard
เครื่องเล่นยอดนิยมในโซนนี้ Revenge of the Mummy เป็นรถไฟเหาะวิ่งไปในความมืด หนีการล้างแค้นของมัมมี่ ความน่ากลัวอยู่ที่ไม่รู้ว่ารถไฟกำลังวิ่งไปในทิศทางไหน ข้างในทำเอฟเฟคสวยงาม มีหมอก มีควัน มีถอยหลังตีลังกา ใครลองเล่นแล้ว ส่วนมากจะเบิ้ลอีกรอบ สนุกจริง มีจุดหวาดเสียวก่อนจบเรื่อง
Treasure Hunters เป็นรถ Jeep นั่งได้คันละ 4 คน วิ่งไปตามราง เราไม่ต้องขับ ระหว่างทางจะเจอกับสัตว์ร้ายเช่น จระเข้ งู ฝูงแมลง เครื่องใช้ต่างๆ 1 รอบประมาณ 5 นาที เหมือนนั่งชมวิวเพลินๆ
Sci-Fi City
มีเครื่องเล่นชื่อ Transformers The Ride เปิดให้บริการตั้งแต่ธันวาคม 2011 รูปแบบของเครื่องเล่น Transformers จะให้ผู้เล่นขึ้นยานเคลื่อนที่ ใส่แว่นสามมิติ เราผู้เล่นจะเป็นฝ่ายของออพติมัส หนีการไล่ล่าของฝ่ายดีเซฟติคอน (ตามเนื้อเรื่องหนัง) ยานจะมีการเคลื่อนที่ขึ้นลง ซ้ายขวา โยกหลบ โดนระเบิด มีระเบิด ประกายไฟ เข้าหายาน สมจริงสมจัง เหมือนอยู่ในเหตุการณ์จริงเนื้อเรื่องสนุกจริง ตื่นเต้นตลอด พอดีเราชอบหนังเรื่องนี้เป็นทุนเดิม
Roller coaster สูงเท่ากับตึก 14 ชั้น จัดว่าเป็นเครื่องเล่นที่ต้องมาเล่นให้ได้ เมื่อมา Universal Studios
Battlestar Galactica HUMAN รถไฟเหาะสายสีแดง เป็นที่นั่งแบบเท้าติดพื้น วิ่งด้วยความเร็วสูงถึง 90 กิโลเมตร/ชม. จะวิ่งผ่านโค้งถึง 14 ชั้น แต่ไม่มีตีลังกา ก่อนจะเล่นเครื่องเล่นนี้ต้องฝากของที่ Locker ก่อน
Battlestar Galactica CYLON รถไฟเหาะสายสีน้ำเงิน นั่งห้อยขา ไม่มีที่วางเท้า วิ่งด้วยความเร็วบนรางโค้ง + ตีลังกา ควงสว่าน หวาดเสียว ก่อนจะเล่นเครื่องเล่นนี้ต้องฝากของที่ Locker ก่อน
Accelerator เครื่องเล่นรูปถ้วย เล่นได้ทั้งเด็กและผู้ใหญ่ นั่งได้ 2-5 คน จะหมุนเป็นวงกลมไปเรื่อยๆ ไม่น่ากลัวแต่จะเวียนหัวนิดหน่อย รอบหนึ่งประมาณ 5-10 นาที โดยเพิ่มแรงเหวี่ยงมากขึ้นไม่ได้มากอะไร แต่บางคนก็เวียนศีรษะ
New York
โซนนี้เหมาะที่จะเดินเล่น หามุมถ่ายรูป มีรถค��าสสิคจอดให้ถ่ายรูป ตึกจำลอง สถาปัตยกรรมในนิวยอร์ค
สิ่งที่น่าสนใจในโซนนี้ก็มี Lights, Camera, Action Hosted by Steven Spielberg เป็นเบื้องหลังการถ่ายทำหนัง เข้าไปที่ห้องแรกจะฉายวีดีโอ Steven Spielberg พูดถึงเทคนิคการถ่ายทำภาพยนตร์ จอเหมือนในกองถ่าย เดินต่อไปห้องที่สอง เหมือนเหมือนสตูดิโอ ฉากด้านหน้าเป็นเมืองนิวยอร์คที่ฝนกำลังตกหนัก มีลมพัดและละอองน้ำเหมือนจริง มีฟ้าผ่า ไฟไหม้ร้อนจริงๆ แท่นที่เรายืนอยู่ก็สั่นได้ด้วย ตอนจนน่าตกใจก็ เมื่อเรือลำใหญ่โผล่มาจากไหนไม่รู้จะแล่นมาชนเรา ราวกับเรือไททานิคระเบิด",USS ครั้งแรก,2017-04-01,SOLO,reoku68,"Bangkok, Thailand",Bangkok,Thailand,1

This place is good for children of all ages but maybe except babies, though they do have good facilities when you have kiddos less than 2 years old. 

You are not allowed to bring food and drinks inside the park since you are forced to buy them inside. You can bring an empty bottle since there are water stations inside. 

What I liked best in the park were the live shows since we don't have much of those in the Philippines. To see all the shows you first need to check their schedules so as not to miss out on any. These shows are really entertaining!!!

The one area that they don’t do as well in is queue management. We opted not to pay the extra to get the express pass (which in hind sight was a mistake) and waited in line from 30 mins to 2 hours for every ride. It ruined an otherwise really great day. We actually ended up leaving mid afternoon because we couldn’t stand the thought of another queue. The worst part about this was that the wait times posted outside were so far from reality. We went in one queue because it said the wait time was 20 minutes and we were in line for almost 2 hours.

Disney’s fast pass system seems to be a lot fairer than the express pass system Universal used and it doesn’t cost extra.

But, once gates opened, it didnt take us long to get in the gate. Immediately went straight to the rollercoaster rides and waited around 10 minutes to get on. But, after this the lines for the rides generally had at least 30 minutes to an hour wait to get a ride. Even with the express pass (extra $$ ontop of standard ticket), people were waiting around 15 minutes. In some ways it was way better than Dreamworld in Australia, such as the amount of effort put into the detail of the areas (statues, surroundings, colours, design ect ect). But Dreamworld has some far superior Adrenalin rides. As an Australian what we would recommend is:
# Go on a weekday around 2pm and dont purchase the express ticket. We found after this time, it was so much more pleasant and the wait time for the rides was far less. And around 6-8pm, the wait time was 5 minutes for every ride. 
# Even though the Park dont like it, take your own food in your back pack, as prices were as expected HIGH and just average variety
# the top rides for us in order: 1st The Mummy Ride, 2nd Cylon Rollercoaster 3rd Transformers 4th The rapids ride 5th Human rollercoaster 6th enchanted rollercoaster.

My advice are targetted to those who goes in groups and seeks some thrilling adventure.

- It can get real hot during the noon, slippers and shorts are advisable.
- Do get a map upon entering.
- There are rides which you need to have your bags out into a locker, it is free for the first 30 minutes.
- Waiting time for the famous attractions like transfomers 3D, battlestar galatica and revenge of the mummy can easily go up to 140 minutes wait time during the morning

Hacks:
1. Ask for single rider rides for younsters who go with groups. You can easily cut a 140 minute queue , they are usually hidden.
2. As other reviewers said, you have to run into the park early and queue for the best attractions early, BUT I say otherwise. If you plan to visit USS till the closing time, usually 3 hours before closing, tour and huge groups have gone.

The entry ticket for this place is SGD  76 per person but the place gets extremely crowded during the weekends. Unfortunately, we visited over the weekend and had to buy an ""Express pass"" which you can use to skip the queue. The express pass has dynamic pricing and this being a weekend, we had to shell out SGD 70 per person (it usually ranges from 50 to 80 SGD for an express pass) but it was worth it since we were able to enjoy almost all the rides where the people without the passes were waiting in queue for about 2 hours!
The best of the rides are Transformers ride, Cylon and Human (Cylon was extremely thrilling and human was relatively better), revenge of the mummy, the lost world and lights camera action by Steven Spielberg. During the weekends the park is open till 8PM (check with the person at the ticket counter) and they also have fireworks at 8.30PM. There was a hollywood parade at 3pm for about 20 mins which was also good. We were lucky to witness the fireworks show which lasted for 10-15 mins but was a pleasure to watch. 
The place is very well made and you can easily spend an entire day roaming here and doing some or the other activities. 
Singapore being a hot and humid country, it helps to carry a cap/hat, shades and a sunscreen since majority of your day is spent under the sun.

8,557918663,2018-02-02,MOBILE,5,"Если вы в Сингапуре и у вас есть свободный день, то рекомендую потратить его на Тематический парк развлечений Universal Studios Singapore. Находится он на острове Сентоза, на котором, кроме парка развлечений, находятся еще акванариум и пляж. Добраться до парка можно как на такси, так и специальном монорельсе и канатной дороге. Для любителей максимально экономить и много ходить существует и пешая дорога. Самый оптимальный способ: доехать до станции метро Harbour Front и пересесть на монорельс Sentosa Express. Выход со станции метро и станция монорельса находятся в одном здании - в торговом центре VivoCity. Из монорельса выйти на станции Waterfront Station. Входные билеты в парк можно купить перед посадкой на монорельс. Сам парк разделен на 7 тематических зон: Голливуд, Нью-Йорк, Научная фантастика, Древний Египет, Затерянный мир, Тридевятое королевство, Мадагаскар. Каждая зона оформлена соотвественно теме - музыка, статуи, кафешки, сувенирные магазины и, конечно же, аттракционы. Аттракционы, которые понравились больше всего: Transformers (с 3D очками), Battlestar Galactica (самые большие горки в Азии), Revenge of the Mummy (горки в темноте с элементами хоррора), Canopy Flyer (горки на высоте птичьего полета), Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure (сплав на плотах). Также рекомендую посмотреть шоу Waterworld по мотивам фильма «Водный мир». Отличное представление! Идет два раза в день: 13:30 и 16:45. Важно знать, что вы можете намокнуть, если сядете на первые ряды во время шоу. Для любителей кино рекомендую «аттракцион» Lights, Camera, Action. Впрочем, это аттракционы, которые понравились нам, взрослым. Для детей вы найдете много других интересных развлечений. Также внутри парка есть кафешки. Рекомендую кафе  Mel’s Drive In в стиле Америки 40-50 годов. Очень вкусные бургеры. Можно, конечно же, выйти из парка (поставив печать re-entry) и найти поблизости ресторан, но не рекомендую тратить на это время, так как даже целого дня будет мало для того, чтобы полностью осмотреть парк и опробовать все развлечения. Входной билет стоит около 50-60 USD. Советую приобрести специальную карту Universal Express (около 25 USD), с помощью которой вы сможете проходить на аттракционы обходя основную очередь. Ведь на некоторые аттракционы можно попасть только простояв 40-50 минут в очереди (особенно по выходным). Так что лучше всего идти в парк по будням с самого утра до закрытия. Время работы: 10:00 - 19:00 (по будням).",Целая вселенная развлечений!,2018-01-01,FRIENDS,Sardor Babaev,"Tashkent, Uzbekistan",Tashkent,Uzbekistan,1

I had a great time with my teenage son. The queues are not so big in the beginning ... some rides in the morning only had 10 minutes. However as the day progressed the queues got bigger so we did go for upgrade “Express Pass”’ - however except for the big ticket rides we could have done without it.

The park has a lot more rides and roller coaster than the US parks which focus more on the experimental element of movies making. So missing from Universal is the famous tram ride through the studio sound stages (which I think is always the biggest draw)

However what was done well was the “Far Far Away” land of shrek, the Mummy ride, the transformers ride - the 2 huge roller coasters were really incredible and highly enjoyable.

Yes the park is expensive, lockers are charged, but I feel you’ll go there once ... so I didn’t mind it.

I loved Almo TV production which was so entertaining with live dancing enjoyable for all ages ... unfortunately the only movie making studio experience is “Lights Camera Action “ ride which is hosted by Spielberg - replicating a sound stage where a tornado hits New York ... that was wonderful (wish there was more of that).

到那邊可先到Vivo city櫃檯買票哦

我們是買
環球影城一日票+接駁車來回=SGD$68
（比環球影城現場買便宜10%）
購票方式有很多種 可能也有更便宜的 請自行上網查詢~

也有快速通關票 就是每種遊樂設施大概最久只要排10分鐘或者
不用排隊就可以進去玩了 但票的價位當然比較貴～

營業時間：星期一～日10:00am-7:00pm
建議 平日去！平日去！平日去！
才可以玩到很多 且拍照也不會旁邊都是人
雖然某些主題區真的太多人了 也很難p掉他們

分為7個主題區：
好萊塢
紐約
科幻城市
古埃及
失落的世界
遙遠王國
馬達加斯加

入場後 當然就是先拿一張園區地圖
地圖有分很多種語言
英文、中文、日語、韓語...
但我通常都會多拿一張地圖回台灣給家人看 像我媽就很喜歡看種東西

因為當天是下午入場
所以要趕在太陽下山前拍一拍照
所以就已拍照為主

每個遊樂設施 外面有個板子都有寫排隊時間
超～貼心的 這樣可以斟酌自己要不要玩
只要看到外面寫30分鐘以下的
我們大概都會排隊去玩
但也不是每個遊樂設施都好玩哦！
我是有先上網查詢哪個必玩（好玩）、哪些沒玩到也不會怎樣的
這樣去環球影城玩才不會太失望

新加坡地方小
但環球影城卻是麻雀雖小 五臟俱全
園區路線規劃的非常好　走一圈 就走完全部了 所以很少會漏掉沒去的地方

我覺得可拍照的幾個地方是...
入場前外面那顆大球（寫UNIVERSAL STUDIOS）

園區：
✔好萊塢街道
✔遙遠王國的城堡
✔芝麻街
✔變形金剛
✔古埃及神像
✔隨時都會有人偶出現 拍照要排隊

我覺得遊樂設施我大概只完了三分之一或更少
因為主要是拍照

但我覺得好玩的遊樂設施有...
史瑞克4-D電影院
（像電影院的座位 戴上3D眼鏡 一起跟著史瑞克拯救費歐娜吧
座椅會隨著場景變動 還會噴水和煙霧）：我們是坐比較前面
所以一直被水噴 但不是很誇張那種 很好玩

木箱漂流記
（水上漂流之旅 可以看馬達加斯加每個場景 很有趣）：
最記憶深刻的是前面有一個瀑布 我們全部的人都怕淋濕還想要拿包包擋
結果要到的時候 瀑布的水會往兩側流 完全不會噴濕我們害我們虛驚一場

小龍飛行學校
（就是小型的��霄飛車）：可能我比較膽小 所以我覺得很刺激
一路尖叫 非常適合小朋友玩的

變形金剛3D對決之終極戰鬥
（乘坐車輛造型的設施 隨著場景變換 車輛會左右上下起伏 很真實很刺激）：
我覺得全部最好玩的就是這個 但也是排隊拍最久的一個
因為忘記看外面寫的排隊時間 排了快一小時

以上都是我有玩過覺得好玩的，至於不好玩的也有但不多 就自行上網查詢囉！

園區各個地方都有表演節目
需要自行先去看表演時間
對這個興趣不大 都是走著走著 有的話就排隊進去看 沒有的話當然就算了

新幣真的不便宜
所以吃喝和買東西都要三思
建議大家自帶水壺哦！
因為要一直玩一直走 加上天氣熱很容易口渴
而每個廁所外都有飲水機可以加水
所以千萬記得要自帶水壺！
不然一直買水和飲料 錢包可能就失血了

園區也有很多好吃的餐點
但因為我們是吃完午餐才進去
也不打算在裡面吃晚餐 因為貴啊～
所以到了晚上六點就點了一個史瑞克造型的鬆餅SGD$8-9（價錢忘了）
上面有淋巧克力醬 還不錯吃喔

原本想買芝麻街藍色那隻「餅乾怪獸」的髪枯
看到很多女生戴頭上超可愛
但三思過後 決定不買
因為可能只戴一次 之後也不會帶

但我們有轉三個紀念幣 一個SGD$2
分別是變形金剛、芝麻街、小小兵

慢慢玩 慢慢走 拍照 到處看 吃東西...
就用掉一天的行程了 很值得

Tip on ticketing: safest way is to use physical paper. Me and many others with paperless barcode could only make the machine beeps to open the gate at second attempt. If it’s not practical to you, just make sure the barcode can be zoomed in to the biggest size uncut without your thumbs holding it.

We got there before opening to ensure we got in the gates straight away to literally gap it to the rides that traditionally attract the longest queues. We headed straight for Revenge of the Mummy and the Transformers rides. Both were the best rides I have ever experienced. Because we were there early before crowds built up, we could tell how busy these rides get simply by meandering through the very long waiting area.

We then ventured to The Lost World just to find out it doesn't open until 11am. NOTE: It is worth checking when each area opens, show times and plan your day. For example, the Water World Show is fantastic, but if you've seen it, you might like to target the rapids ride while the crowds are watching the show.

Throughout Universal Studios they have screens giving indication of wait times for each ride.

On our second visit we discovered more and more rides we didn't realise we had missed the first time. This is partly due to becoming more familiar with the park by the second visit.

Please find below some tips from my personal expetience:

1. Hit the Universal Studio at 10am if you would like to enjoy the venue completely. Get hold of the map & the show timings( for that day).
2. Buy the express pass.I don't think you will find a day when the venue is not crowded. It gives you the option to skip long ques though it can be used only once for each ride. Some rides like hunters or canopy flyer do not have an express entry.
3. Carry just one small bag per family.
4. Don't waste time in clicking pictures, you gave ample time to do that upon your return.
5.Your first stop should be the Transformer ride & then you can move to Gallectica or the Mummy ride, lost world(opens at 11am)
6. At the que-up for each ride approx. waiting time is mentioned. Check that before using your express entry. As express pass can be used only once for that particular ride.
7. You can get an empty bottle to refill water supply.
8. There at lot of lockers available for you to store your stuff (first 45 minutes are free). If you have an express pass & you manage your rides, one can avoid paying for the storage.
9.Plan your day so that you can move around & n't miss your favourite shows.
10.It is good to take quick bites & avoid heavy food to enjoy the rides to the fullest.
11. Only Jurrasic Park Rapids ride in Lost world makes you drenched. You can either pick up the rain coat or use the dryer booths (for 5$) after the ride.
12 If you would like to see the show, reach the venue before 15 minutes so that you can pick your favourite seat.
13. There are lot of souvenirs & T-shirts you can pick from various outlets. But they are expensive.

These tips will help you to cover about 80%of the park.

If you have children, they might want to stay longer to take photos with the characters and ride the kiddie attractions. It opens at 10 AM and closes at 7 PM on weekdays - it's better to come on weekdays to avoid the crowd!

Save photographs for later and start queuing up for the rides early on. Turn right and start walking to Sci-Fi City to ride the best attractions in the theme park. Start the day with Transformers: The Ride 3D, and make your way to Battlestar Galactica: Human vs Cylon.

Then I went to take the Roller Coaster ride and still get goosebumps... WHAT A RIDE!!!! It was... and never ever think of missing the Jurassic World and the ride... wonderful technology used to make the extinct animals alive and can visit other small rides of Jurassic world.

Do not forget to watch the Shrek movie and you will be amazed along with Puss in Boots ride.

So i stood in line for my absolutely favourite ride Cylon for TWO HOURS after which i promptly bought a one  year pass as i intend to go back again. This express pass allows you unlimited rides in the express line where the wait is not more than 15 mins on average. and if, like me, you visit the park more than once and ride the attractions again and again, you more than make up the cost of the express pass.

I went back to Universal for 5 days out for the 10 I was in Singapore. It's my favourite and I intend on going back tagain and again till my pass expires! The two most thrilling rides are Human Vs Cylon [Cylon is scarier] and the Revenge of the Mummy[ ride in total darkness for most of it].

I was carrying him while this happened so I was literally covered in vomitus while he continued to vomit. 4 staffs witnessed that and none of them provided any aids. We asked for the emergency exit, and after being shown the way we were abandoned there, essentially a save-yourself situation.

We limbed our way out to the toilet and took some time to clean my son and myself up, while my wife and daughter went away to buy some t-shirts for us to change.

ピーク期ですが現地は休日ではないので混んでも大したことないかなと思ってエクスプレスパスは購入しませんでした。
チケットは事前にvoyaginで購入しました。
開園直後に行きましたが事前購入チケットの引き換え窓口がわからず、とりあえず当日券のチケットブースの行列に並びました。
２０分くらいで順番が回ってきましたが、バウチャーを見せるとここでは使えない、そっちの窓口に行けとのこと。
見るとチケットブースに隠れるようにして裏に事前購入者用の窓口がありました。
その窓口はチケットブースの小屋に完全に隠れるように存在し、大変気づき難いです。その窓口は空いていましたので無駄に行列にならんでしまいました。
初めての方は注意したほうが良いでしょう。

トランスフォーマーが最長で６０分くらい並びましたが、それ以外は概ね５～３０分前後の待ち時間でした。
しかし２つのコースターは常に６０分待ちの表示でした。
閉園までいる予定だったので最後に乗ろうかと思いましたが、閉園３０分前でも６０分待ちの表示でしたのであきらめました。
ほぼ丸一日インパしていましたが、結論から言うとエクスプレスパス無しだとよほどの閑散期以外は全部は制覇できないと思います。
小児向けのアトラクションやショーは体験していませんし、時間が合わずウォーターワールドも見ていません。途中雷警報のためアトラクションがストップし行列内で３０分ほど足止め時間がありましたがその他、昼食も園内でさっさと済ませ無駄に過ごした時間はないのですがこの結果でした。
確実に制覇したい方はエクスプレスパスは必須と思います。

最後にジュラシックパークザライドに関して重要なことをひとつ
日本と同じように乗る前にカッパを売っていますが、メインで濡れるのは下半身です。
特にボート内の足元に水が浸入し貯まる（水深５～１０センチくらい）ので素足でサンダルが良いでしょう。靴下＆布製スニーカーだと悲惨です。

The park itself if not big, but they pack a lot into the space and it does mean that it doesn't take forever to get from one ride to another. Not many 'big' rides but plenty of variety to suit all the family,  and lots of photo opportunities. Tip. Go on a ride with official photo early on,  then at the end of the ride,  instead of purchasing the printed photo (or photos), ask for the option to purchase a scan ticket. For 55 dollars you can then ask the vendor to scan your ticket at every photo op and when you're done,  pop into the darkroom next to Starbucks I  the way out, and you'll be able to choose one actual printed photo but have the ability to download all the photos youve had taken throughout the day and therefore make unlimited copies for yourself .. very good value.  Also, if you're a single rider, most rides allow you to enter a separate line which  may mean that you get on the ride quicker. Other than that,  the waiting time for the most popular rides averaged between 40 mins and an hour even on a rainy day, so you may wish to consider the fast pass option.

O acesso pelo metrô é bem fácil, vá até a estação Vivo City, e de lá já abasteça seu cartão para pegar o metrô à ilha, que para na entrada do parque. É bom levar boné, protetor solar, mochila pra guardar as coisas, e uma roupa/sapato que possa molhar (além dos brinquedos na água, também pode chover, afinal é Singapura). Pra alguns brinquedos é preciso deixar os pertences dentro de um armário, pago à parte, ou alguém tem que ficar de fora pra ficar com as coisas.

Recomendo que junto do ingresso, compre também o adicional ""fast pass"", é caro mas vai te poupar algumas horas de fila no sol e no calor! Se não tivéssemos comprado esse adicional, provavelmente não teríamos tido tempo de ir em todos os brinquedos que queríamos (dependendo do horário, as filas chegam a quase 2h de espera!). Infelizmente, o ""fast pass"" só dá direito a ir uma vez em cada brinquedo sem pegar a fila, então é sempre bom olhar se a fila está muito grande mesmo antes de ""queimar"" seu cartãozinho sem necessidade.

Dito isso, é só se divertir, o parque é um sonho! Dividido por filmes, como Shrek, Madagascar, A Múmia, Jurassic Park, Minions, são várias as opções de montanhas russas, simuladores, brinquedos na água, todos são muito divertidos! Na saída de cada ""seção"", sempre tem lojinhas de souvenir temáticas, e todo o parque parece uma cidade cenográfica, sempre tem personagens passando, desfiles, apresentações.

Located on the island of Sentosa, the Unviersal studios merits one day visit easily. Even that may not be sufficient for seeing all the rides that the place has to offer. Open only for a  period of 8 hours from 10.00 am to 6.00 pm, most top attractions have waits of anywhere from 40 minutes to 1.5 hours.  The entire park is divided into 7 theme based zones . Hollywood – the central boulevard that houses shopping and other memorabilia , also has a large central avenue where most of the meet and greet characters come along. Madagascar – based on the eponymous movie , has one ride and one carousel ride. This section is for kids and can be easily completed in less than an hour and sees lesser rush as compared to other more exciting sections.  Far Far Away is a cartoon character based section based on the movie Shrek and its spin offs.  The Lost World is  a dinosaur based theme area. The Ancient Egypt is based on the “Mummy” series.  The Sci Fi section is based on the themes of sci-fi movies like Transformers and Battlestar Galactica. The section houses 3 of the top rides in the Universal Studios viz.  The Transformers Ride and 2 roller coasters – HUMAN and CYCLONE.  The New York section bases itself on shows and attractions based on the Big Apple. 
With 2 kids and 2 adults, and despite going on weekday, we could not complete the whole park in 1 day. However we did manage to complete  a major part with some few key rides  (you can check out the details on the website) which were : 
1.	Madagascar -  A Crate Adventure (Madagascar section)  - Joint Fun adventure, go with whole family
2.	Puss in boots – Giant journey (Far Far Away section) -  Good coaster for the family, but had the longest wait time we encountered.
3.	Enchanted Airways   (Far Far Away section ) – A junior coaster, great fun for the whole family.
4.	Waterworld   (The Lost World section) – Great live show. Superb stunts, take raincoats if you plan to sit in the first few rows –named aptly as the Splash Zone.
5.	Canopy Flyer  (The Lost World Section )	 -  Flies over a large part of the Lost World section.  Can take kids along. My kids loved it a lot.
6.	Dino Soarin  (The Lost World Section ) -  A merry go round, where the seats go up and down based on your commands.  Again – great fun for kids.
7.	Treasure Hunter  (Ancient Egypt) -  A very simple journey on wheels  - great for kids. Take it only if one has time on hands.
8.	Revenge of the Mummy (Ancient Egypt) -  One of the most underrated rides in the whole park.  Starts of slowly, then it is basically a roller coaster ride in near darkness. When you cant anticipate what you are about to experience, gives the ride a total different feel. Kids not allowed. Not to be missed. 
9.	Battlestar galactica - HUMAN  (Sci Fi City) – Great Coaster, great corkscrew turns and full body inversions. Don’t miss.
10.	Accelerator (Sci Fi City) -  A fun ride for the whole family.  Basically seated in a tea cup, you are rotated  on 2 different paths at the same time.  
11.	Transformers ride  (Sci-Fi City) -  Absolutely among the top 2 rides in the whole park.  a 3-D adventure, where your vehicle is accelerated , decelerated with sideways jerks  - all with a great back story of all the major Transformer characters including  - Bumblebee, Optimus Prime and Megatron, all chasing the All-spark.
12.	Lights Camera Action (New York) -  A standing show , which mimics a hurricane about to hit the  Big Apple. Must for the whole family. Not to be missed.
13.	Spaghetti Space Chase (New York) -  a simple coaster ride based on Sesame Street TV series. 
14.	MEet and Greet (Hollywood) -  We met characters from the Universal movies including Shrek, Gru and the kids had a great time with the Minions.

While we completed majority of the parks, there were a few rides we missed on account of long wait times or the  tight schedule. They were:
•	Battlestar Galactica – CYCLON (Sci-Fi City)  -  This is  the complementary roller coaster of the HUMAN –mentioned earlier.
•	Jurassic Rapids Adventure (The Lost World) -  A water ride, which wets you thoroughly. But considered by many to be one of the best rides.

We did this from 10.15-14.30 as we had decided to leave the US and go and view the Aquarium with a view to returning to US afterwards. This worked well for us. We did the transformers ride, Shrek 4D, the water world show and Madagascar within that time and the longest we were waiting for anything was an hour. There is lots to see and do. On our return from the aquarium US was quieter and the queues were 30 minutes, much better. My only real criticism are the prices and as others have alluded to paying the prices we do you shouldn't really spend the majority of your time in a queue.

Then had lunch at the Oasis restaurant in Ancient Egypt(The mango crusher here is yum!)

So hurried onto the indoor Shrek 4D adventure and by the time it finished the rain was also over and the outdoor rides were just starting so did the Puss in Boots giant journey next.

We took the park passes at site and were recommended a super express add on ( unlimited access to all the rides at 100 dollars each). We were four with two adults and teenager and a child. 
We were told that he rides will be operational till 9 pm and hence we opted to add the express passes.
Unfortunately most of the rides stopped taking customers on by 7 pm itself. In one of the rides we were told that it is closed due to the weather , but throughout our ev I felt say there was no rain, lightning or thunder storm.
The rides which were functional has less staff much much lesser than the afternoon an took much longer. For me as a visitor it looked pretty intentional.
Ani he few rides were closed at around 7.30 since they mentioned these are closed for fireworks late evening.

On our recent visit ($76 per adult, $56 per child) the Express Ride Pass that can be purchased on site for between $70 - $100 per person was the only viable way to get the children on rides. 

After waiting over 100 minutes to get on one ride (with the wait time quoted at 5 minutes on entry) and watching the Express Pass holders given priority on a roughly 4 to 1 basis, we had little choice but to splurge an extra $140 for the two kids just to get on rides. We actually hated ourselves for doing it because it goes majorly against our sense of justice in terms of all people being able to access everything equally, but had no choice as so many others had bought the Express Ride Pass.

The children tell me the rides are pretty good, but not as good as other parks. When it started drizzling or raining, all of the outdoor coasters were shut down. The children are adamant that they prefer the SkyLine Luge on Sentosa actually. The food at the park is passable. The park itself is well set out and easy to get around.

We’re no cheapskates but overall, the park was overpriced significantly for what it is. If you go on any mildly busy day, make sure you spend up and buy the Express Ride Pass.

Love how Universal is set-up because every themed area has its own attractions, food, toilet, and shops.  There were more rides for teens and adults which is good for my family, and also enjoyed that there is more options when it comes to their merchandise.

Cost of food is pretty standard whichever themed area you are but if you are looking for more authentic food choices there is a hawker style area just right outside Universal Studios which serves plenty of food choices which are less expensive.  (It’s on the right side when you are facing the Universal globe and standing near the entrance).

Being more than twice the determined target age, the main quick fixes of the place would be the Transformers sector of the park which holds the bigger and more adrenaline-rush rides, such as the Cyclone and Human.

0,551315960,2018-01-03,OTHER,4,"The exorbitant entrance ticket price into Universal Studio has always discouraged Singaporeans like me to visit the attraction. A second reason for not visiting the attraction is that I always think that the attraction is more suitable for children and not an old adult like me. It was quite sometime the attraction was opened and this was my first time stepping into this thrilling world of adventures. 

It was a family outing event and I was helping up as a bus guide to ferry my residents from Yew Tee Community Center who had bought the family outing ticket at a subsidized rate of S$20/- per person. The response to the sale of the tickets was overwhelming. It was school holiday period and families were delighted with this attractive discounted ticket offer and especially to Universal Studio which is a star attraction place. The tickets were all sold out instantly the moment it was out. Just my constituency alone, there were 10 buses load of residents! Just imagine the meticulous planning required in terms of transportation and logistics for a GRC. I was one lucky person roped in to help out as bus guide and was given a complimentary ticket for my assistance. Such mega event at Universal Studio was hard to come by without the coordinated effort by all the parties and the generosity support from People's Association and the Universal Studio.  

It was a totally different world as I led my community group of residents into the studio. I felt myself lost in a foreign city like New York, Ancient Egypt with the building structures and architectural design virtually different from Singapore. We came at 5 pm when the sky was still bright and we left at almost midnight. 

All the residents were ushered to meet at the Water World and a series of thrilling, explosive and sensational live water shows with incredible sound effects and death defying stunts caught us by surprise. We were well sobered by the water drizzle occasionally sprayed out by the action packed actors and actresses. Our focus was on that theatrical stage of excitement and our ears bombarded by the sound effects of the gunfire and explosions. 

After the Water World show, I was so excited to explore the rest of the studio. I felt I was returning to my kid days as I found myself in a wonderland of shows, rides, street entertainment, shopping and dining. For the shows, I particularly like the Shriek 4-D Adventure. I could feel the air blasts and water sprays, jumps and bumps as I put on the special glasses to enjoy the honeymoon adventure with Princess Fiona, Shriek and Donkey. The hurricane simulation of New York city was also educational to me to feel that effect of a natural disaster storming a city especially we hardly feel or sense that in a safe city like Singapore. 

As for the rides, I joined families in the Sesame Street Spaghetti space chase but I was worried when I saw the warning advice to those with chronic illnesses for the high speed turbulent roller coasters at the Return of the Mummy and the Transformers 3D think ride. So, I have to miss out on these exciting, exhilarating and thrilling rides enjoyed by most teenagers. 

For the street entertainment, I only saw the Mel's Drive In waitresses in their shake, rattle and roll. I wondered where were the rest of the street performers. 

I supposed the Madagascar adventure was closed likewise with the Amber Rock Climb and the Treasure Hunters. Quite a number of the shops were also closed.

It was New Years Eve and school holidays but I was almost frightened by the size of the crowd at the entrance waiting to get in. Reminded me of the queues at Wembley Stadium before the FA Cup.We had booked on line and paid the extra for express pass. Also we were advised to get there early  by 10 30 am. Was the express pass an advantage well certainly not at the entrance and not on all the rides either. It would have been better if my daughter had a young friend to go on the rides with. There was very little for our baby son to do as most rides had height restrictions. So one adult had to stay with the baby and the other accompanied the daughter. I guess the only ride I went on was Madagascar. The express pass was useful there and the ride in the gondola was fine and interesting. The other rides we were interested in the express pass was not allowed and the queues were from 30 to 60 minutes which was more than I could handle. Not sure if it is always like that or we just picked a very busy time. There is plenty of space inside so most of the crowd was spread out and not claustrophobic. On the plus side there were plenty of seats to sit and rest for a while. There were quite a few strolling players of various film characters and the sleigh with Santa on board was a highlight for me especially when the artificial snow fell down on us we could almost believe we were in Lapland with Santa and his Elves.

We took the free sky train back to the Casino and were very happy to get in the taxi back to our hotel.

The Americans just do it better, with better rides and more variety, but you wouldn’t be at all disappointed visiting this one. The theme park was extremely clean, and well kept. There wasn’t many areas where the park looked tired. 

My only gripe was the price of things. A pizza cost $50, or $11 for a slice. Everything was extremely expensive. 4 chicken wings were $11. Where do they buy their chickens from, France?

The crowds are different in America, compared to Singapore. Without being specific of race, some were blatantly rude and had no consideration, pushing in front of you or taking seats away from your table, without asking. 

Regarding the theme park, we bought the express passes, which cost the 4 of us $400. It was expensive, but it saved us heaps of time waiting in lines. As they say “time is money”. If you can afford it, I would do it, as it gets very hot lining up.

Tickets although somewhat expensive were good value, note that we got S$ 30 discount for paying with MasterCard, I also got 50% discount for being 60 yrs old even though being a foreigner !!  Note: to avoid the long queues its worth paying the S$ 50 extra for the Express pass which means you skip the queues.  In total I paid S$ 88 incl the Express pass.

All the rides and attractions have extensive souvenir shops, but they are seriously expensive.  The food and beverage outlets were also pricy (hence the loss of one star), although there didn't seam to be anyone stopping you from bringing your own (good tip if you are on a budget).

20,548891686,2017-12-23,OTHER,5,"First things first: Universal Studio in Singapore is a must go place and lives up to its hype perfectly!
However, it is critical to plan a bit to save time and get the most out of your day! 

It's a big theme park with lots of rides and shows happening throughout the day. 
The park opens at 10 am and closes at 7 pm. And even an entire day seems less to explore the park in entirety. 

It is highly recommended for people who are pressed on time to buy the express pass. Since the waiting line for popular rides like: Mummy Return, Transformers and Jurassic Park can stretch for 2 hrs for most of the day. 

I managed to experience all the famous rides and shows with express pass and I was done by 5.00 pm flat (i had to leave early to catch a flight).

But, I realised that buying the Expensive express pass (50 Singapore $ on top of standard pass) wasn't worth it. Since, all rides/shows are not covered under it. And with careful planning you can achieve the benefits of express pass with the standard pass. Yes, it's very doable with following tips.

Core tips:
# 1: Strict arrival on time: 10 am
# 2: Don't take pictures with Universal Studio Globe at the start, keep this for the last. Otherwise you will be wasting precious visits.
# 3: Go directly to the famous rides of Revenge of the Mummy, Transformers first! Don't get distracted by Hollywood area :) Keep it for later.
# 4: Follow the above by the 2 rollercoster rides of Battlestar Galactica: Human & Cyclon. Do the Human first, Cyclon is not for faint hearted. Take this ride before the lunch.
# Next is Jurassic park which opens at 11 am. Highlight is the river adventure. Again a must do experience. Don't worry about getting wet, there only some light sprinklers here and there. 
And second in Jurassic Park is the canopy ride (if the line is too long, this can be avoided). You can get similar experience in Puss in boots ride later.

Show Tips:
# 1: Must watch: Shrek 4-D Adventure and WaterWorld. The latter is very impressive.
# 2: Seasame street play is only for kids.
Food Tips:
# 1: Take lunch between 12-1 pm to avoid the rush of 1-2 pm.
# 2: Most preferred in Mel's burger diner. Don't waste time to browse through the expensive 6-7 other places. Mel's diner is near to street shows & Cinema shows which are mostly in around Hollywood area. It's good to watch shows to relax after the meal. 
# Bring some light snacks and a bottle of water.

Extra Tips
# 1: People with Express Pass, pls DON'T make the mistake of using it when the queue is short! You will definitely want to repeat Revenge of Mummy and Transformers ride during the afternoon OR the evening when the queue is very long.
# 2: Don't waste much time in taking pictures. Keep this for 4-7 pm around time.
# 3: Treasure Hunt is for small kids (can be avoided for adults entirely)
# 4: Merchandise is really expensive. Don't waste precious time to spend.",Tips to ace your Universal Studio trip!,2017-12-01,COUPLES,Ankit B,,,,-1

1,548719641,2017-12-22,OTHER,4,"This was my first Universal Studios visit.  I read reviews and watched videos of the rides beforehand, because my partner scares easily and can't handle anything too much like a roller coaster.  I decided we could handle the Transformers ride.  It was the first one we went to, right when the park opened, and the line-up was still 30 minutes.  But it was well worth the wait.  The coordinated combination of mobile cart seating, real and projected scenery, warm and cold air blasts, and 3D glasses puts you IN an action movie.  Everyone was screaming and holding-on for dear life!  I forced my eyes to stay open for the whole ride, because I didn't want to miss a thing.  You can't imagine being thrown up 10 stories into the air, but it feels like it on this ride.

I had to do Battlestar Galactica roller coasters by myself.  The Cylon zero-G roll was a highlight and worth the 15 minute wait.  But the lines were longer for the Human side, and it wasn't so unique, so skip it unless you pay extra for the express pass.

I was going to skip the mummy, but the line was really short.  It seemed completely non-scary to me, but kids might get a thrill.  I did like the fire and cold effects.

We enjoyed Shrek 4-D, a 3-D movie with motion seats.  Pay attention at the end and follow the 3-D trail to it's landing spot in the theatre, or you'll miss one of the funniest parts.

The Speilburg Hollywood experience was also good.  Don't wear suede.

I was non-plussed at the express pass system at first.  Early in the day, I waited 45 minutes for the Human BSG coaster in a very slow moving line, while people kept passing in the express lane.  When I could finally see the gates, I could count that for every coaster from the regular line, there were 2 coasters from the express line.  This makes the wait times posted out front very inaccurate, and you should expect around double the posted wait time.  If I knew, I would have skipped this ride.

1.チケット購入
日本でＵＳＳのホームページからチケットを購入して、入口の読み取り機にプリントアウトしたバーコードをかざすと入場できます。
因みにＵＳＳホームページだと60才以上は半額になります。60才以下はVoyaginでネット購入すると10％引きです。

2.行き方　
MRTのハーバーフロントまで行き、セントサ・、モノレールに乗り換えます。USSのあるウォーターフロント・ステーションまではMRTの券売機で通しでは買えません。MRTのハーバーフロント駅とモノレールのセントサ駅はVIVOCITY（ショッピングセンター）内にあり、エスカレーターを乗り継いで上がります。
乗車券売り場（スタンドで係員が販売）で乗車券と入島料のチケットを買います。
USSの入場券セットもあるので気を付けてください。モノレール駅に入場するとき以外は、乗降車ともチケットをチェックすることはありませんでした。

3.ジュラシックパーク・ラピッド・アドベンチャー
ひざ下まであるレインコートが必要です。河を下る円形ライドは水しぶきを浴びるのは勿論で、乗降の際の乗客の足跡で座席がドロドロでした。

4.リベンジ・オブ・ザ・マミー
内容を知らずに乗ったのですが、真っ暗の中を疾走するコースターで本当に怖かったです。（私的意見）

5.ハードな乗り物は入場時は有料コインロッカーに荷物を預ける様に入口で注意されます。
ロッカーはモニター画面で誕生日と好きな色を入力し、標示されたローカー番号を利用します。誕生日と色が暗証番号として出し入れする型です。日本語表示を選択することができます。
暗証番号はＤＤ（日）/ＭＭ（月）/ＹＹ（年は二ケタ）です。色はサンプルから選ぶ方式です。

Have a good meal or dinner after instead. Wear a hat or bring an umbrella, you'll be lining up under the sun most of the time. Know that you can't bring a camera on some of the rides (lockers are available on-site), bring a spare battery for your camera if you're the shutter-happy type.

72$ for your entry and 150$ for the unlimited pass thats per person, having got in we did the whole park and rides in about 2 hours and did the popular rides 3 times each and I'm sorry but we didn't feel bad about all the poor kids waiting in the queues, as the day before we waited, so the result is pay up and do the fast pass and don't eat for 3 days! if you are on limited time and want to do it all, its good but not fantastic i think the park should relook at there pass structure as there is going to be a lot of irate people if they pay and can't get on anything, bit of a ripoff we thought especially for the poor kids!!

1,546212759,2017-12-09,MOBILE,4,We went on a MasterCard offer so got $10  off the normal price. We purchased a priority pass for a further $50 so total price of $118 per person. It is clearly not a cheap day out but the rides were great  and appealed to all tastes. Some were exhilarating and some more sedate. The day we went was fairly quiet given the length of the queues in comparison to empty space in the barriers bit we still had to wait up to 30 mins for a ride when we didn't use the queue buster ticket (ie we came for a second time on a ride). You can buy an even more expensive upgrade which gives unlimited queue priority bit o think that was another $30 each so.could have taken the ticket to $148 each which would have been too expensive for me. All in all a great day but ok much queuing potential and if you don't have a queue buster ticket and it's a busy day I believe it would be a day filled with standing in queues! It being Christmas Santa showed up with his sleigh which was great. There were live performers on the streets singing and dancing. Lots and lots of laughter and fun for us all. I accept that queuing us absolutely part of a day out like this and therefore unavoidable even though it does take away some of the enjoyment on my case.

It is not that crowded if you come early like 10am when the place just open, when midday, it is so hot the sun is blaring and make sure to bring water bottle or buy one so you stay hydrate. bring hat or umbrella. when waiting for the ride, mostly have air conditioning so it is not that hot, but some ride don't have that, like the roller coaster one in sci-fi area.
make sure to come at least crowded day, like weekday so you don't have to wait too long. if you have more budget, just go for express pass, the staff let in the express line so much that it makes the standard line have to wait longer. it is very different from USJ where the staff let in the express line and standard line together so standard time still get to ride (ex. for 8seats attraction, 4 from express, 4 from standard). When I ride the roller coaster (the one that make your leg hanging) when the train come (8 seats), the staff let in the standard line (which is 100++ people)  and express line (like only 15people max) alternately, so the first one is 8 people from standard, the next train is 8 people from express, which is not fair because express only have 15people. I've seen group ride that ride twice while I still didn't get on it for once. And there's so little attraction that have single rider line, so you can't really cut waiting time.
In the USJ, you only get to ride the express line for once for one attraction, in USS you get to ride that attraction for multiple times with one express pass. It is not fair for standard ticket holder.
The bottom line is, Go to USJ, it is bigger, It is less hot (in december), There is minion town (USS still doesnt have that), the staff more friendly, there's many life size character that wander around that you can photograph freely. in USS, you gotta pay if you wanna take a picture with huge transformer statue.

The park is very pretty, well done and fun.  Other thrills: Revenge of the Mummy is a good dark ride (good effects) with a fun dark coaster.  Excellent sim ride in Transformers, and some fun in Lights Camera Action too.

Some Tips that might help you.

1. Business hrs 10am-6pm. Come early to enjoy the whole amusement park.

2.Avoid weekends n public holidays. You will waste your money because you will queue quite long for just 1 ride. When we went there on a weekend, we queued for  1hr and 40mins for the TRANSFORMERS ride.
  PS they sell EXPRESS PASS  to avoid queues but it will cost you around $30 and above. 
 
3. Bring water bottle, sometimes people check ur bag because food n drinks are not allowed inside because they have restaurants n food carta inside to cater u. But water bottle should be ok because there are water fountains where u can refill water.

4.Bring extra shirt or a raincoat. Some rides can make u extremely wet, well if u gonna buy raincoat there it will cost u $10(last time i visited). Blowdry booth $5.

Plus shows(theatrical performance) like WATERWORLD where you can get wet if you sit at the wrong seat. Well all seats are color coded and they will inform you if those seats are prone to getting wet during the show.  

5. There are lockers u can rent for free for the first 60mins. Because bags are not allowed at some rides.

6. Check for online promos for the tix to save money. Just make sure the site is legit.

7. Take a map for yourself at the entrance, saves you time wandering where’s this n that.

8. Wear comfy shoes because u will walk n queue the whole day so dont burden yourself as if you’re attending New York Fashion Week.

9.Bring the necessaries; caps,camera,selfie sticks, water bottle,medicine(headache/diarrhea etc.)

10. Watch out for your valuable things(well, this is singapore but that doesnt mean you can escape from bad people who are tempted to do bad things)

Our toddler loved the pteranodon ride and the carousel was a hit too. The Madagascar ride was a bit scary for him but still a great ride if you have a young child given it’s on a boat with real water. The Elmo show was good but the costumes looked a little tired, perhaps they need some sprucing!!

Our tip if travelling with young children;
- Bring cash as some of the food stalls which sell popcorn in the novelty containers (Minions etc) do not accept cards and are cash only. Our son had a minor tantrum whilst we had to go to the other side of the park for an ATM
- Do all the family friendly rides first. Even though they are targeted for little kids you have older people still wanting to go on them and the wait gets long later in the day.
- Bring sunscreen and a hat for your kids, and change of clothes as there is not a lot of shade as you walk round the park and they will get hot and sweaty 
- The only baby change facilities and feeding room is near the entrance. There are 2 feeding spots, microwave and water as well as a TV and seats. Good to cool down if you kids are tired.",Fun day out,2017-11-01,FAMILY,missriss,"Sydney, Australia",Sydney,Australia,1

I don't know what happened to USS communication between their different departments; obviously these people seemed not to be on the same page.

For Malaysian u need to convert money at Malaysia. At here also can convert but not much as youcan get at malaysia money changer. This place so pack with peoples. So happenning. 

Pros
1.Value For money- Although a bit expensive because of currencies, but im sure you wont regret
2.Many rides that can make your adrenaline rush.
3.You can watch a costumes parade at Saturday
4.Toilet easy to find.
5.Many booths sale drink and food.
6.Suitable for children under 3 years. But many rides need to above 3 years old.
7. Nice view for taking pictures.
8. The uss souveniers very cheap at the end of the day. Save your cash lads.

Cons
1. You need express pass if you want go at Saturday. I'm get in line for Transformer for 40 minutes just for 10 minutes ride. But really worth it.
2. Better bring you own water or food because in USS all that so expensive.
3. Bring towel or some spare clothes. For the Jurassic rides, you will get wet.
4.At my visit the Galactica rides closed. So sad. Always check at their web for rides maintenance.
5. For me 1 day visit not enough. But if u got some cash better get 2 day pass or express pass
6. So hot and u need hat or so what ever to cover your head. If you got sunscreen, that would be good.

“Puss in Boots and Kitty Softpaws” shake their legs in an entertaining show.

It’s divided in 5 or 6 zones (I’m unable to recollect properly) & there’s something happening at any given moment in each zone. Do remember to pick up the schedule from entrance to be on top of things.
I would suggest that this place should be covered over 2 days so you can enjoy every ride and show but that tends to become costly so you can instead plan to reach here as soon as it opens so you can make the most of things, also wear comfortable shoes, carry hats/ caps and towels and be prepared for a long sunny day. I personally couldn’t cover the entire park nor could I find another day to come back here (which I still regret!) 
I saw the waterworld show which is amazing so do see that, also from what I saw, if meeting characters and seeing them dance etc n getting pix with them is not important for you then you can simply skip every meet n greet session in there and focus more on other stuff. The donkey show isn’t worth the time either.
Also, if you’re going to visit during holiday season then you might consider purchasing VIP pass, check your dates against local holidays or peak tourism season and if required purchase them online as you’ll save some money.

Sadly this has changed. We just got back from a day there- this time with our two young kids (7 months and 3 years) and realised that it’s a whole different experience with children. 

To start with, the rental stroller we hired was not just filthy (there was grime all over the seat and sides) but when we eventually tried to open up the shade we saw that it was broken. Hey couldn’t exchange it for us as all the baby ones were sold out. If the park takes so much care to ensure that public places such as toilets etc are maintained well (they are) then something as important as a baby stroller too should fall under that category. 

The staff are either too tired or overworked as it was rare to get a smile out of many of them and they were rude, abrupt and short at rides especially when they saw my 3 year old. These were for rides where he met the height requirements so we weren’t asking for any favours. The Sesame Street ride attendant was exceptionally rude and I wish I had given him a piece of my mind then. 

As for meet and greets, we were first given the wrong location for the minions and we waited patiently only to realise later that the q was formed at the entrance instead. There was only Gru there and when asked about the rest we were told they will be back at 5pm. So we hung around till then and joined the line only to be told that the limit was up and no more pics. Now while I understand that the line does need to stop somewhere, there is a way in which this can be communicated and rudeness isn’t one of them. I strongly suggest the staff get retrained in manners, politeness and basic courtesy especially when delivering bad news to a 3 year old who has waited all day for something.  Kind of ruined our entire experience after that.

I’ve two boys 8 and 6, one a daredevil the other the complete opposite, thus making life difficult.

On face value I would recommend families to attend but I cannot stress enough, find a quiet day.  Some of the potential queues would push me over the edge. I’m not joking they can be 400m long and wait times up to 90 mins. Yes 90 mins for a 5 mins ride.

My suggestions are...

Buy tickets online and get there 20mins before the gates open. The highlight was the transformers ride but it gets busy quickly so unless you’ve a desire to run to the ride first up, wait until very late in the day. We attempted to go around 11am to find wait times of 60 mins. We elected to return at 5pm and the queue was only 5mins.

If you don’t mind being split up take the single rider queue. Let’s be honest you rarely talk to a friend during a ride so get through quicker.

Food/Drinks are very expensive. You can enter and leave the park so venture outside for a lunch break, the mall covers all taste buds plus you’ll miss the busy part of the day.

Watch out for line jumpers....unfortunately it’s difficult for the park to monitor this and it’s unreasonable to judge the park on patrons behaviour but there are certain groups that believe they can simply push in... One group did this in front of an employee and my understanding was they are to be ejected from the park.

5,539452997,2017-11-08,OTHER,3,"I'm a theme park nerd, and I travel to parks all over the world.  Universal Studios Singapore (""USS"" from here on) has been on my list ever since the park first opened in 2010 and I was SO excited to finally be able to visit it a few weeks ago!

I'll try and be brief.  The park is tiny (only 49 acres/20 hectares in size) compared to the other existing (as of 2017) Universal Studios theme parks.  I did a complete walk around the park in about 10 minutes.  Everything can be seen from across the central lagoon, and the transitions from the 7 different themed zones are quite abrupt, due to the lack of available real estate.  (Fun fact:  the park is built on top of the parking garage!)  This isn't necessarily bad in and of itself--the park has a nice variety of attractions to enjoy, but it makes any chances of future park expansion difficult at best.

The park is beautifully designed and themed, the souvenirs are pretty typical for a theme park, yet they are unique to USS (which is a good thing!), and the food offerings are as culturally diverse as the people you will see visiting the park (which made for some amazing educational opportunities and the chance to talk to people from around the world)!  They had typical western fare (burgers, fries, milkshakes, pizza, fried chicken, etc), but they also had Chinese and Middle Eastern foods, as well as foods from other countries.  For a theme park, the quality of the food and the prices weren't bad.  Refills of fountain drinks are not free though!

Attractions and entertainment are where the park really shines though.  Of all the entertainment I saw, none of it is featured in its American Universal Studios siblings, yet all of it felt familiar and of the same quality as the 3 other Universal Resorts.  If English is your primary (or only) language, you will fit right in here, as English is the official language of Singapore and it is spoken in the park.  The rides and attractions are almost exclusively unique to USS.  While the park had clones of the American Transformers and Revenge of the Mummy rides (the USS version of the Mummy is identical to the Orlando version with a slightly different and better storyline), their rides had a unique take and theme to them that made them feel novel and new again.  Shrek 4D is the same show as in Orlando, but USS put theirs inside of Princess Fiona's parents' castle in Far Far Away...a nice touch.  Waterworld is exactly the same show as featured in Hollywood and Osaka.  However, the rest of the park attractions are completely unique to USS.  The dueling (when they feel like dueling them) Battlestar Galactica coasters are thrilling without being terrifying; Puss In Boots' Giant Journey is a short yet gentle suspended roller coaster that is perfect for young riders venturing into ""adult"" coasters; Madagascar:  A Crate Adventure is a gentle dark/water ride that is suitable for all ages and located in one of the coolest show buildings ever built at any Universal theme park; Lights, Camera, Action! Hosted by Steven Spielberg is a nod to the Universal Special Effects Shows of the 80s and 90s (and I REALLY miss both the Backdraft and Twister attractions in the US) themed to a Category 5 major hurricane striking New York City; and the Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure is the best Jurassic Park water ride ever created by Universal Creative.  Seriously, it's intense, unique, original, and far more enjoyable than the 2 JP clones at the American Universal parks.  The diversity of attractions is there, allowing all guests--young and old, ride lover or not--to find plenty of things to occupy them during a day spent at the park.

But then you get to the issue that really detracted from my day's enjoyment:  bad management.  USS is not owned by Universal Parks and Resorts (Comcast NBCUniversal), but rather by the Asian gaming and energy corporation, The Genting Group.  This means that USS operates completely differently than the other 3 Universal-owned resorts.  What does that mean?  USS didn't operate at what I would consider to be ""The Universal Standard.""  Everywhere I looked, corners were being cut to save time and money.  Many of the Team Members (employees) weren't overly helpful or friendly, Battlestar Galactica wasn't being dueled for a large part of the day (meaning instead of launching the 2 coasters together to let them interact with each other as they were designed, they would launch one by itself and launch the other one whenever it was ready.  Occasionally they would duel, but it wasn't common), clothing sizes were small (my fiancee--a very petite 4'9"" tall woman, born and raised in southeast Asia--wears a women's medium t-shirt in the US, but had to buy a large at USS.  I couldn't find a shirt that fit me, since the largest shirt they offered was XL and it was more like a Large at biggest), prices were noticeably higher on many items--souvenirs especially--than they are in the US, food portion sizes were tiny for the prices being charged, line-jumping was routine and not enforced (even when done in front of team members and even when being listed as a rule that will get you ejected from the park if you violate it), Universal Express Pass (front-of-line pass) purchasers were forced to stand in long lines as they favored the regular stand-by lines over the Express Lines (which defeats the purpose of buying an Express Pass!), etc.  These are small things, but when they add up over the course of the day, it begins to get frustrating and take away from the enjoyment of the day at the park.  I'm sure many of these ""negatives"" are due to cultural differences between the US and Asia, but I can't help but think that many of them wouldn't be happening if Comcast owned USS like it does Orlando, Hollywood and Osaka.

Gripes aside, it's a nice park that is definitely worth a visit if you're a fan of Universal Studios and you're in Singapore with some free time on your hands.  Sentosa Island (the resort island that USS is built on) is FULL of different attractions to occupy your time.  My fiancee and I spent an entire weekend on Sentosa and still didn't come close to doing everything that is offered.  Gate prices are extremely reasonable compared to the American parks (like less than half price for the day at USS compared to Hollywood, and ⅓ the price compared to Orlando), and there are plenty of other things to do within steps of USS' front gate.  If they would make some managerial fixes to some of the issues I mentioned above, it would be my second favorite Universal park, second to only Orlando!  One last tip:  USS is the only major park in Singapore and it is a major draw to the region.  As such, attendance levels are generally pretty high.  However, if you luck out and manage to visit the park on a quiet day, pace yourself or you will find yourself out of things to do in about 4 hours.

Grab a water from 7-11 near the Merlion, heaps cheaper than inside the park (inside expect to pay about $6 for a bottle of water)

The park was not as busy as what other reviewers experienced, the longest we waited for a ride was 20-30 mins. I'd say on really busy days or if you are in a hurry it was be worth buying the express pass to skip the queues

I would suggest taking a fan, was incredibly hot in some of the lines (Puss in Boots was the worst). We found the food outlets to be priced as expected​.

The best rides were the transformers, Cylon, human and the mummy ride. Many rides have air conditioned lines, if you are looking to escape the heat and rest your legs for a while then go on the Shrek 4D experience!

2,537788365,2017-11-01,MOBILE,4,"Prior to going i read some reviews about this place and was a little concerned. However, we purchased our tickets the day before and got there early to avoid queues. But i think because we went on a weekday it wasn't as busy as some of the other reviews suggested it would be. The longest queue we experienced was only 5 mins long! We had a great time here. I was really impressed in particular with the Waterworld show (unlike the film, this show is epic!). The Transformers ride is like nothing I've ever experienced (and i normally hate 3d) but this was as awesome as it felt realistic. My wife loved it too. You really do get the feeling that you're being dragged through streets and flying through buildings. If you are going with a partner and a child/children, make sure you ask for a parent swap ticket which allows you to avoid queuing up twice if one of you have to look after the kids, it's free. There are plenty of rides and shows for young children too. We didn't have to wait long for any rides right throughout the day. I think if you go on all the rides it is a good full day out even though the park may feel small. The only negative and the only reason why i won't give it a full 5 stars is due to the cost. We paid £75 for 2 adult tickets (my 3 year old daughter went free). Food/drink, as you would expect, is expensive (i had to pay £2 for a can of coke!). And i (as much as my daughter) was looking forward to meeting the Minions but had to make do with Gru :( No need for a VIP ticket though as queues were short!",Great day out,2017-10-01,FAMILY,Soyful A,,,,1

2,537364904,2017-10-31,MOBILE,5,"Universal Studio Singapore or in short USS is a heaven for all children and some sort of a replica of America’ s Disneyland and the special thing about USS is you don’t have to travel far just to catch a glimpse of your Marvel superheroes, childhood’s Sesame Street character or to ride those gigantic and breathtaking roller coaster rides. Everything you can find in the US Disney’s probably 80 per cent you can find here. What’s encouraging is it’s English speaking staffs that will make your life easier rather than worrying about any language barrier. 

As it’s fully recommended to visit USS during off peak season and avoid Singapore’s school holidays in the month of June and December, the queues will be rather long and painstakingly. Other than that, this attraction will give you the best time of your life. First attraction to visit is the show performed by your iconic Disney characters such as the Gingerbread man, Beetle Juice, Cinderella and the list goes on. After completing the half and hour show, drop in to the Sesame Street Land and take a stroll into your childhoods era. Young kids will love this. After that, take a quick panoramic discovery of the Titanic ship and have a wonderful taste of the production set that will surely make your hair stands. 

Subsequently, along the way to the Transformer’s World, there’s plenty of photo opportunities for families and friends to pose with the touch of Hollywood’s synergy. Hence, if you get lucky, there might be street performers entertaining locals and international visitors all day long. Transformer’s will be the next destination where the rides are only for the daredevil riders so children are not recommended. The Egyptian Mummy rides is next followed by the Dinosaur Planetary. If you’re a big fan of the dinosaur from the Jurassic Park movie, this will be an epic ride and plenty of things to do here. The WaterWorld  movie starring Kevin Costner will also be an interesting show to watch and for visitors to take a short break from the hectic marathon walk. 

If you have reached to this stage, you have covered about three quarter of this amazing trip. There’s the Grand canyon boat ride where you will get wet but the cool water will cool you down from the heat sun. The Madagascar ride is my personal favorite with a short boat ride and plenty of scenes from the Madagascan characters including the cute penguins from its original characters.

The Shrek 3D experience is also great for young children and adults to explore and it’s totally air conditioned theatre and plenty of special effects while you’re being seated. The castle is almost identical to the Disney’s, as such, take plenty of photos if you must.

They will also be icons from the Minnion’s cartoon character for you to take photos with. 

Before calling it quits, do pop by the various souvenir shops that covers the whole Disney’s and Universals characters alike. They might be pricy but it’s once in a lifetime visit for some, so, don’t stress too much from burning a hole in your pocket. Just have a great time. The food along the alleys and food courts are very appetizing and do try the local food.

Overall, a pleasant and worth your every penny. You can spend the whole day there and pamper yourselves with a Disney treat. Please do check the best time to visit USS cause Singapore’s rainy season can hamper your planned visit. And to avoid long queues, purchase your tickets online. It saves you time and the hassle of a long queue.",A Merry Wonderland for All Ages in Singapore!!,2017-06-01,FAMILY,RosmanAli,"Bangkok, Thailand",Bangkok,Thailand,1
1,537355266,2017-10-31,MOBILE,4,The first thing to know about Universal is that it's not open very long. It starts at 10am and closes at 6pm. This means you have to get a move on if want to see it all. We were lucky in that it was a quiet day (Tuesday) and the queues were short. A good tip for saving queue time is every ride has a 'single person' line. This line allows you up to the front of the Q but you have to wait for a group of say 3 people on a 4 seater ride and you fill the empty seat. This happens quite often so there is no waiting. Go in as a couple but separately. It's like having a fast pass. Eating is good with plenty of choice. There is a 7/11 with tables just outside the main entrance for half time cheap drinks (just get a exit stamp at the gate to get back in). The roller coasters are the best.

5,537307062,2017-10-30,OTHER,5,"Universal Studios Singapore is indeed a brilliant place. But you need to plan well in order to cover all attractions at USS in a single day. I did manage to squeeze in all the major rides and live shows in a days visit by following the inputs from other members of TA and my suggestions is as follows:-
1) Park Opens at 10. Reach as early as you as can, preferably by taxi (NOT UBER/GRAB as they generally costs you more than the Taxi in Singapore) especially if you are 4 or more (Sentosa Express costs $4 each and taxi takes you there at around $20 from most places in Singapore) 
2) BUY EXPRESS PASS ONLINE along with the entry ticket well in advance, irrespective of whether you are travelling on a weekday or weekend. Think of it as part of ticket price to enter the park itself, so it may pinch li'l less. Express pass is a dynamic thing and may cost you more if you want to get in, see the crowds before deciding whether to buy it or not. USS IS ALWAYS ALWAYS CROWDED. 
3) After entering the park, get the PARK MAP at entry and start in anti-clock fashion cutting straight to Transformers 3D in SCi- Fi City, followed by Battlestar Galactica Human and Cyclone and then to the Mummy (ancient egypt) and Jussaric park Rapids(Lost World) ride because these rides tend to attract the maximum crowd. After you are done with these 5 rides you may choose to explore other rides at your leisure.
4) Collect the live show and character meet and greet timings on your day of visit at entry and plan to meet all the characters that interests you.Don't forget the live shows in the madness of the rides. Water World and Lights Camera Action are a must watch and are as good as the Roller coasters if not better.
5) Madagascar and Far Far away has rides for Kids, but you can still explore them later starting in anti-clock direction since they tend to be less crowded.
6) Carry some food (drinking water is mostly available for refill), if you want, since food inside the park is generally costly but mostly bland. Your own food and drinks can help save the day if you are under the hot sun for a long time. Carry Sunscreen and umbrellas since the weather can be unpredictable.
7) If you are photo op take atleast two rounds of the park. One for the rides and next for the photos. The park is not huge and you can still discover new things in your second and third round if you have saved time using EXPRESS PASS.",Memories of Lifetime in a single day,2017-10-01,FAMILY,Aditya_Saraf,"Kolkata (Calcutta), India",Kolkata (Calcutta),India,1

9,537036135,2017-10-30,OTHER,4,"Siamo stati agli Universal Studios di Singapore il 13/09/17 (giorno in settimana). Questa attrazione è sita a sud di Singapore, sull'isola di Sentosa. Per raggiungerla basta prendere la metropolita MRT sino alla stazione di Harbour Front (linee gialla e viola), prendere la passerella pedonale (lunga circa 650 metri) che costeggia la strada principale e porta sino all'isola di Sentosa. L'ingresso agli Universal Studios ha un costo di 47,70 € (per adulto), pagabile anche con carta di credito. Il parco è aperto dalle ore 10 alle ore 18. Essendo in settimana non era troppo affollato e le code alle attrazioni sono state abbastanza veloci. Il parco è suddiviso in varie aree: 
- Madagascar (con Marty, Gloria, Alex, Melman e gli altri simpatici personaggi), 
- Far Far Away (un tuffo nella favola con Shrek e Fiona),
- Lost World (a spasso con i dinosauri di Jurassic Park, l'attrazione piace molto ed è parecchio affollata, ci si bagna parecchio), 
- Antico Egitto (montagne russe fantastiche: effetti sonori/luminosi realizzati bene), 
- Sci-Fi City (per gli amanti dei transformers con due montagne russe davvero paurose: vanno in simbiosi intersecandosi più e più volte l'una con l'altra), 
- New York (tra drive-in e scenografie di interi quartieri newyorchesi),
- Hollywood (alla scoperta degli effetti cinematografici più sensazionali).
Ci sono molte aree ristoro/bar dove bere/mangiare (la sera aimé chiudono presto, prima ancora della chiusura del parco). Molti negozi di souvenir soprattutto sulla strada d'ingresso dove, su ambo i lati, sono installate le stelle di grandi attori/artisti/cantanti/registi. Lungo le vie del parco è facile incontrar i protagonisti delle attrazioni (con cui farsi fotografare): dalla combriccola di Madagascar con il loro balletto agli esuberanti dei muppets, dalla sensuale Marilyn Monroe agli dei dell'antico Egitto con Anubi. Il Parco è ben distribuito, sembra di ritrovarsi in un altro mondo, e da l'opportunità di tornare bambini per un giorno. Il costo dell'ingresso è un pò caro, come pure la ristorazione/souvenir, ma ne vale la pena. Per molte attrazioni è richiesto salire senza zaini/borse per motivi di sicurezza; ci sono diversi depositi autogestiti con armadietti a tempo (45/60 minuti per pochi $ di Singapore) con combinazione personalizzata/impronta digitale. Sicuramente è un attrazione da vivere se si passa per Singapore qualche giorno. Nei giorni sereni il sole è davvero forte: usate occhiali da sole e crema solare, un abbigliamento leggero e comodo.

The only thing is its crowded and if you go around noon you will end up standing in line for hours for your turn. We ended up standing 1.5 hours for one ride and 2 hours for another. But wish someone had told us about the VIP pass where the wait is shorter and the line moves faster. However if you are stuck with a normal ticket then there is also the option of single person where even if you are with a few people but don't mind going solo on a ride then they use you to fill out the empty seats and trust me this is much faster. 
So best is to go right in the morning when the rush is less and then towards the evening as well the wait is hardly 5 minutes, only mid day to about 5 pm its crazy.

Horrible: Madagascar, Enchanted Airway (Far Far Away)... with more not even worth mentioning.

Highly recommend the Cylon, Mummy and Transformers!! They are a must-try!! 

I feel the admission tickets are a bit pricey, with $76 for an adult ticket, and if you need an unlimited express pass (cause the queues are horrendous) you would need to top up with another $50. This adds up to be quite a lot for a family. 

One thing I have to highlight that was quite disappointing was the estimated waiting time that they shown at the entrance of each ride. I saw that the waiting time was estimated to be 20mins at the Cylon so I went to queue. However, it turned out to be more than an hour! The area that we were queuing was packed, dark and stuffy, especially at the staircase portion. Because we thought it was only 20mins, we continued to wait but at each turn, it was just more people waiting. 

I understand that queues are unavoidable but it think USS needs to provide a better estimate. If I knew that it was gonna be more than an hour, I could have chose to eat lunch or take another ride instead of queuing. When I finally was the next in line to board the Cylon, the fire alarm rang and everyone was evacuated. I know we need to leave due to safety reasons but in my mind was that I wouldn’t even have queued in the first place if I was given the correct info and it resulted in me wasting more than an hour of queueing.

Universal studios though lacks in some areas understandable as nothing is flawless still strikes the mark of excitement and one day is simply not enough to do absolutely everything in Santosa and Universal studios so prepare to take alot of money with you if you like to buy momentum's though entrance from the above site was very reasonable.

Ranging from Sesame Street boat rides for the little ones to full on roller coaster outside to sensory deprivation  rollercoaster underground in the form of mummy returns. Excitement is for all. Shows regularly occur such as dancing shows, Donkey from Shrek has a live stand up and all out puppet shows. Characters from shows were supposed to be making appearance but we only saw two of them, one being Marilyn Monroe. I was a little upset as I looked forward to my picture with Shrek but there was no Shrek.

It was really busy and some of the queues were huge so I'd recommend getting express passes we waited for the Transformer ride for over an hour I began to think the queue was the ride... When we finally got on the ride we were both blown away by a 4D spectacle of a ride. It was wow.

They have a crazy American styled dinner that's something straight out of Grease Lightning.it was very cool. 

The mummy returns ride is recommended.Toilets were easily accessible and everywhere. They were preparing for Halloween so spooky decorations were up looking great.I couldn't justify paying the same price of the ticket I paid to get in again on top to come back later and see the Halloween party of the park though I wish I really could.

Best advice is to GO EARLY at opening time. Almost everyone on the Sentosa express was headed this way. 

When we had seen everyone headed for the Universal direction we wanted to purchase express line tickets (x3) , however when we wished to purchase, the customer service rep suggested we not purchase as we would not get our money's worth as the children's rides do not have a long line. We went with their advice and decided if we still wished to purchase we could buy it within the park. Their advice proved true. The most we had to wait was for the Madagascar boat ride which was 30 mins as it was at the beginning of the park. 

All other children's rides were about 10-15 mins wait and the transformers was about 30 mins however the lines move fast which does not make it seem long.

Universal studio does have a lot to offer but in my opinion, it perhaps is aimed at slightly older children but it’s best to arrive early.

Unfortunately, I felt let down by majority of the ride descriptions. All of the rides either had incorrect descriptions or not descriptive enough. For example; there was a children’s Madagascar water ride that stated it would go up and down but it was flat throughout.

The transformer 4d experience ride was fantastic (for an adult). Staff had let young children on the ride including my own, which most children ended up crying because it was dark and simulated falling at times. 

The mummy ride was not clearly labelled other than it stated fast rollercoaster on one sign half way through the walk (within the queuing system). The ride was scary with most people either crying or shouting out expletives, as the rollercoaster has a free falling drop in pitch black but thrill seekers would love it!

Other than that it was very enjoyable for my family. There is a minion section including a minion mart, Jurassic Park land, a comedy show at the land far far away was funny and interactive, shrek ride, Sesame Street rides and few live street performers. 

Overall it was good experience. However you may want to bring plenty of water as it can get very hot and perhaps waterproofs as some rides have water rides.

之後開始一路玩，幾乎任何設施都不太用排隊，最長排隊時間大概也30分鐘，很多設施都順順的一下就玩到，我是在平日造訪，是跟這有關嗎？總覺得花錢去買快速通關根本不需要，除了遊樂設施，那些表演也不錯，芝麻街的太兒童取向了，大人看會覺得普通，但水世界就很精采，演員還會跟觀眾互動，在未來世界的咖啡杯大概是最無聊的，馬達加斯加的坐車旅行也很普通，但變形金剛、侏羅記公園的坐船都很有趣，玩了一天，最終免不了要去買點精品，總覺得沒什麼特別想買的，跟去日本時不同。

2) Express pass. On weekends, get it! Dont think twice. If you dont want to spend the extra money... then better not go, trust me. You will waste 1h waiting for 2 minutes thrill its so not worthed. On weekdays though, my suggestion is to first take an ""recognition lap"". Go around the park and see in the main attractions what is the waiting estimated time. If less then 20 min i would say its not worthed the extra money. If more then that then go buy that express pass at any store inside the park.

You don't want to wait in line in the heat to get a ticket. Get there early. Plan to do ""big"" rides first if they have short wait time(under 15 mins). We lucked out going on a weekend and had many short lines.Big tip: if you have just one person that wants to go on a ride. They can go in the single rider lane and just fill in the spaces on rides with uneven groups. If one of our kids wanted to do a ride again alone- this was great! The treasure hunter ride was not worth the wait. It was our longest wait - 30min. And was very boring. Transformers seems to be everyone's favorite. The scenery is great-but as we've been to many amusement parks- we were looking for rides. As there were relatively few -it was a bit of a let down. But, the sets are amazing.

To add further to their greed of making money, they have put an unrealistic time limit of 1 day each for Sentosa and Universal Studios. With the amount of people who are allowed to enter these two attractions and given unimaginable queues, there is no way that any one can complete even 40% of rides in 1 day. 

They make you pay through your nose and then make you stand in queues. It is very disgusting and insulting for anyone to treat their guests like that. It is an impossible situation if you have young kids and/or elderly people with you.

If the owners want to be fair in their dealings, there should be an upper limit on the number of tickets they sell so that only that many people can enter which will not result in overcrowding. If they do not want to put this limit, they must remove 1 day expiry limit and allow people at least 2 days in each of these places. 

When I wrote to Sentosa about the above, they were quite rude in their response. They simply said that they do not intend that the guest should be able to do all rides. They refused to provide any explanation for the fact that why do they allow such large crowds in. 

It is a shame if any one spends money on expensive flights and hotels to go to Singapore and waste more than half of the holidays standing in unending and poorly managed queues.

The rest of the day went well, but my only complaint is about the Mummy. The queue was inside a cramped ispace and was so claustrophobic you could barely breath. Once you went in you could not get out and there was no priority lane for the VIP pass. That said, the ride itself was thrilling! 

I would recommend Universal Studios as the place for people who are willing to have an adventure, but get the VIP pass otherwise you will spend the day queuing!",Our Universal Studios Adventure 2017,2017-08-01,FRIENDS,Ruben_Heather,"Ha Tien, Vietnam",Ha Tien,Vietnam,1

This allowed us to be one of the first in line and we were super fortunate to get selected as the family of the day to officially open the park. As a reward for the honour, we were given some individual ride express passes to use and a few other freebies. How lucky and what a special moment for my family. 
The park itself is outstanding, advice-get there early and head straight to your favourite ride. We managed to do all 3 of the 'big' rides straight away, transformers, battlestar and the mummy, all with no wait time at all. We visited on a Monday and wait times were very reasonable. There were only a couple of times in the day we needed to use our free express pass and even then wait times were listed as 40 minutes, but nowhere near this. The most we waited was 10 minutes. My advice would be to wait to buy the express pass until you arrive, you may not need it. We managed to do every single ride in the park and several twice, and barely needed the express. 
The rides themselves are amazing, transformers was out of this world. The stunt shows such as waterworks and Steven Spielberg show are wonderful and a great way to take a break from the heat. Make sure you catch as many shows as possible and break up the day from all the adrenalin.

1. Watch out for weekends or public holidays (in SGP or nearby eg Malaysia). It can be very frustrating if u have to wait for 20 mins per ride
2.  Buy tickets online... u save a lot (eg a regular ticket for SGD 74 would be available as low as 50). 
3. Buy express tickets if its moderately crowded.... if no crowds u will feel u wasted money.... if its too crowded... everyone buys express and u still wait 20-30 mins per ride. These are exp (100+SGD/ pax)... so be cautious
4. The rides start from left (its a circular route as you enter)... and increasingly get rougher. So if you have a small kid/ arent looking for the most audacious rides.... maximise your time spent in first half (i would say till the transformers section).
5. The food at the food court is very mediocre... eat a heavy breakfast and then get out and have lunch. You can easily cover this in 3 hours on a less crowded day.","Good outing, with very clear watch outs",2017-09-01,FAMILY,Amitabh Gupta,"Parra, India",Parra,India,1

We had already bought our tickets and were going to add an express pass but this was going to be an extra $80 Singapore EACH!. So we decided against that. If you can prebuy with the express pass included then do so.
Some rides have a 'solo riders' line which goes direct to the front of the queue which is a great idea as the queue can get up to 1.5hrs but the single rider queue was only 20 people long. They take from this queue as they need to to fill up spare seats. So it is a lottery as to when you will ride but heaps quicker than waiting.

Purchasing tickets in advance in addition to express passes gave us entry via the express/VIP queue located on the far left of the main gates and has us on our first ride within a few minutes of the park opening.

Make no mistake, there will be queues of up to an hour for some rides. If you're travelling with young kids who have little patience, the express unlimited passes are worth every dollar.

We waited no longer than 5 minutes for any ride and often skipped ahead of a 45 minute queue in the regular lines.

Knowing this, we wouldn't visit again unless in a position to buy the express unlimited passes.

Food and merchandise options are reasonable and priced as expected.

We spent a full day at the park and covered all rides (including riding some up to 5 times each) and the waterworld show with ease.

1,529608063,2017-10-03,OTHER,5,"This is an amusement park for adults and children alike.
Located on Sentosa Island, Singapore, you will be advised to visit this place early in the morning when they open at around 10.00am.

This is because they have different thrilling rides, live shows and street entertainment that you can watch around the park at different times of the day.

Two shows that you definitely must watch are:
1) Waterworld show, which is a live-action 20 minute skit with pyrotechnics and defying stunts.
2) Sesame Street ""Elmo"" show at the Hollywood Pantage theatre. (It also lasts about 20 minutes).

The ""Elmo"" show is a kids-friendly stage performance with dancing and humour by your Sesame Street characters. 
Visitors are to note that this is a ENGLISH-language show with no subtitles/captions.

The ""Waterworld"" show involves moderate use of pyrotechnics. 
Visitors with very young children (eg: babies) are warned, as young children/babies can be startled by the loud pyrotechnics and sounds (eg: firing of blanks, fires and explosions, etc).
Visitors who do not wish to get WET should not sit in the first few rows (known as soak zones), as there is ""pre-show entertainment"" where the cast members may go around the ""soak zones"" to shoot small amounts of water via water pistols.
You have to be prepared that the cast members may go around and pick out members of the audience and dip your cap in the water, or soak your hair in the pail of water that they may bring around!

For the rides, these are in order of scare factor:
1) CYCLONE (You will be hanging 360 degrees in the air when the ride goes out; I seriously advise visitors with HEART CONDITIONS/OTHER KNOWN MEDICAL CONDITIONS not to attempt this)

2) BATTLESTAR GALATICA (You will be turned up to 180 degrees when the ride goes out, but your legs will be on a solid platform. Visitors with severe fear of heights should refrain from attempting)

3) THE MUMMY ride (It's a indoor-roller coaster ride, where you will be turning up to 45 degrees. It is a bit scary, as you will be riding in pitch darkness for most of the ride and there is a segment at the start where you will be descending backwards).

4) Jurassic Park waterboat ride (This is not as scary and young children can also attempt this ride. BUT do note that you will DEFINITELY be soaked by water, and SPLASHED WET. Visitors should not wear covered/leather shoes as there is high chance that your shoes can be mildly/moderately damaged. Do consider making this your last ride, if you do not want to be wet for the rest of the day in the park!)

TIP FOR VISITORS:
The waiting time for ""Battlestar Galatica"" can be the longest; about 1.5hours to 2hours on a typical busy day.
It will eat into your time for all the other rides in the park!
I will STRONGLY recommend all visitors who have only one day to spend at the park to purchase the ""Universal Express"" pass, which lets you take a shorter waiting queue at most of the key (popular) attractions, like Battlestar Galatica, Cyclone and a few others. Otherwise, you will likely not be able to try ALL the rides/see all the shows within one day!
(take note that there is a ""SINGLE RIDER"" option for some of the rides/attractions, which allows you to jump to the head of the queue, AS LONG AS YOU ARE VISITING ALONE, OR YOU ARE WILLING TO BREAK UP FROM YOUR GROUP AND SIT IN THE RIDE BY YOURSELF WITH OTHER STRANGERS!)
Those who just want to try all the rides and do not mind breaking up from your group should consider this option!

Those who are visiting the park for only one day should get a copy of the day's programmes (showtimes for selected shows, like Waterworld, Sesame Street Elmo Show, etc) at the entrance of the park (There is a display cabinet with copies of the day's programmes) and plan your sequence of trying the rides/watching the shows.

Take note not to miss the ""Waterworld"" show, which currently has a last session of the day at around 3.15pm on weekdays!

Telephoned the number provided to us when the system went down on 2 occasions and were advised they could take payment for the entry tickets over the phone but could not book the VIP passes for us over the phone and said we would have to purchase these online or at the gate. During both phone calls the staff acknowledged that they could see our purchases in the online shopping cart and that the problem with the booking website was their issue. Unfortunately the pricing for the VIP passes is dynamic, so it increases the closer your get to the day. We were originally going to pay $50 extra per person for the VIP passes (on top of the entry ticket price) but the price was already up to a extra $90 per person by the morning of our visit and we weren't prepared to spend an extra $160 for 4 of us when the problem was with the Universal booking site and they would not honour the original price we had tried to purchase.

However it is apparent that management is at least 2 levels lower compared to US or Japan. 
The park is understaffed and there is not sufficient staff to manage queues, monitor safety, operate the rides, answer questions, etc. We saw a woman doing all by herself and hence the very slow services.
We queued for Mummy ride because the sign indicated 15 mins waiting time outside.10 mins in technical issue was announced and we were told to leave but no sign or instructions. People just scrambled their way out of the site.
Worst was the human galactic ride. The sign said 20 mins when we entered but changed to 30 mins immediately afterwards. The queue moved very slow and we had to send representatives to open and re-rent the lockers at 30 mins as we didn't see ourselves able to complete the ride within the 45 min free locker time. At the end it was 75 mins when it came to our turn. When we exited, the sign said 40 mins. Totally misleading.
Apparently the park let Express Tickets go first and we saw far too many times that 3 quarters of the seats were offered to Express Tickets holders. Shouldn't there be at least a quota system for different kinds of tickets, just like Disneyland FastPass, rather than offering all availability to Express Tickets holders and general tickets holders don't get to go at all?

Invest in an express pass! Expensive but worth every cent, with some queues with waiting times of over 2 hours.

We pre-bought the unlimited express pass, which helped us enjoy our day 10x. Highly recommend it. The difference is that we would be on any ride within 5-10mins, meaning we could enjoy 2-3 rides in the same time it took others to have just one. I'm sure it encouraged us to try more rides, which added to our enjoyment. 

The park is very clean and well maintained. Staff are friendly. And there are rides for all ages.

However, we were silly enough to go on the hottest day of our holiday and nearly died. Our saving grace was water bubblers all over the park which is something you don't see often (especially in Australia).

We bought the fast passes (the cheaper one which gets you 1 go on each ride, not unlimited) and for us that was enough. Our favourite rides were the ‘Battlestar Galactica Cylon’, ‘The Mummy’ and ‘Jurassic Park’ and I recommend trying to get on these before the lines get long and save your fast pass.

Universal Orlando doesn't have the Waterworld show and the Show in Japan is not in English so it was a great watch. It was undercover (although still hot.) I also recommend the 'Light's, camera, action' show.

The park itself was clean and well maintained with plenty of bathroom facilities and p0laces to buy food and drink.

0,527987859,2017-09-28,OTHER,3,"This is a very pretty and clean place just like the rest of Sentosa Island but as a young family of 4 it was hard work. Most of the queue times are clearly displayed outside the ride but there was one ride which didn't have this. It's an awesome ride - the water one where you sit in the big round yellow boats. Great fund for everyone and not too scary. But due to the lack of sign estimating the queue times we actually spent well over two hours in the queue!!!!!!!!! It was crazy and really ruined our experience. We found it especially frustrating to see the people who had paid extra to skip the queues being allowed straight in - surely if we are queuing for two hours they should have to queue for at least 15mins?
Also, the theme park is just quite hard work in that you also have to queue for a long time even to refill those large soft drink bottles. That was very annoying. 
Also, if you have children older than toddler age avoid the Madagascar area as the rides are way too tame and not worth queuing for. 
We were gutted that we didn't get to have a proper look at the Sesame Street area as it was all closed by the time we got there due to the queue times. Maybe they need a few more rides as it doesn't feel as though there are quite enough. Entry is also very confusing regarding where to queue if you have prepaid, which also wasted time.
Another disappointing aspect to the park is that you are not supposed to take in your own food but they have nothing available for people who need to eat a gluten free diet. Thank goodness I always carry emergency snacks!
The drive there in the taxi is lovely as you can see Shrek's castle as you approach which looks fantastic and equally as lovely when you drive away at night. Taxis there and back are so cheap and so easy to access.

The rides are awesome and the must try rides include Transformer and Roller Coster. I heard that Mummy is also good but unfortunately couldnt try due to shortage of time. Be sure that you add ""Universal express"" to your ticket to avoid the wait times. I had a wait time of 50 minutes at roller coster and thats when I realised that buying universal express is surely worth the money.

There are couple of shows as well - one of these is a live performance for and the other is 4D show and my daughter enjoyed both. So if you have a kid, keeping time aside for these shows is surely recommended. 

There are lots of places to eat inside so dont bother packing stuff from outside. Also, its not as huge as the one in Los Angeles so one day is good enough to thoroughly enjoy it. There are shopping areas as well but prices seemed to be on the higher side so you can buy the same stuff outside at a relatively lower price. 

We had a baby stroller and there was no issue in using it inside so dont worry about moving around if you too have a baby stroller.

It is recommended to carry a camera but its fine if you miss carrying one. So plan a day at Universal studios and dont forget to add Universal Express to your ticket.

推荐指数：5星      建议游玩时间：1天
推荐项目：变形金刚、过山车、埃及探险、史莱克4D影院
门票价格：74新币（370RMB），优先券30新币起。

优先券：
游乐园内的需要排队的大型娱乐项目都有专门的优先通道，每个项目凭优先券可享受一次优先。如果你游玩时间有限，那么这个优先券建议一定要买。优先券的价格从30新币起，园区会根据园区每天的游客人数动态调整优先券的价格。人流高峰时价格甚至会远远超出门票的价格几倍，高达好几百新币。这次游玩，我们只有大概两个小时的时间，如果没有优先券，过山车、变形金刚、埃及探险一类的每项排队至少得占用半个小时以上的时间。
里面的游玩项目个人做如下推荐：
变形金刚3D对决之终极战斗：
必玩项目。推荐理由：利用3D眼镜配合大屏投影和汽车的真实加速度体验营造虚拟现实的场景带来强烈的真实体验感和现场感。说白了就是让你仿佛置身于变形金刚之内的视角，与汽车人体验真实的战斗。里面最刺激的一幕是你的车从高处垂直落向地面，虽然最后并没有真实坠落时的那么大撞击力，但效果的逼真度是唯一的一个让我的感官愿意相信这是真实的。
过山车：
推荐项目。体验感受世界最大的双轨过山车，超刺激的各种超重、失重及突发变加速体验，让你肾上腺素飙升。玩这个需要一定胆量和身体条件。容易头晕目眩恶心呕吐以及心脏承受力不好的，建议谨慎选择。
木乃伊复仇记室内过山车：
推荐项目。和变形金刚项目类似。也是营造真实体验的娱乐项目。不过这个不需要带3D眼镜。都是以实景打造。一开始的场景让你仿佛走进埃及藏宝的墓穴之中，然后开始被各种守卫者追赶，甚至会感到被封闭在一个漆黑的密室之中，然后顶棚四周喷出从蓝到色的火焰。然后最刺激的来历。你仿佛被扔进时空隧道之中开始座过山车，然而四周是一片漆黑，让你无法预判下一秒会被甩向哪里。给你带来比过山车更意想不到的刺激体验。
史莱克4D影院
由于之前没体验过4D电影，这次特意来体验一次。和普通的3D电影比多了座位的震动和喷雾的装置。比如在电影演到坐马车奔跑时，你的座位会被向后倾斜起来然后前后晃荡。在史莱克打喷嚏时你会感到有雾气喷过来。这些效果其实带来的真实体验还是有限的。至少并没有让我的感官愿意相信这是真实的。",来新加坡绝对值得一玩的景点,2016-10-01,BUSINESS,,,,,1

I am not the only one either, I heard plenty of other patrons complaining!
Two of the main attractions, The revenge of the mummy and Jurassic Park Adventure were closed, the main reasons why my family visited the park. Then to make matters worse, the Singapore rain came. The way the park managed the rainy situation was appalling and I was a bit amused at how millions could of been spent to set up an amuse meant park, weather-wise, in such and unpredictable place. The rain then meant the Battlestar Galactica had to close which means there was only 1 ride open. How can you expect to pay S$79 for a park which closes down it's three main rides???????? Value for money.. not! The queue for Transformers was about 1:30hours  long, and according to other people experiences, that is a short queue for this place. When we got in the ride though, it was very well-done, with amazing special effects. If the wait time was smaller, I would have truly enjoyed the ride. 
We went on a Monday; a work day and school day. It was not peak but still chaotic! However, when we were getting frustrated, the staff were generally friendly and hospitable, with one of the ladies at Jurassic Park offering us a one-time-only fast pass so my Grandfather didn't have to stand in a long queue with a sore leg. Even I was getting sore knees!!

Just when there was a little hope to get into a good ride, it rained again, so we were forced to only use indoor rides, so basically just Transformers or Shrek 4-D (which was very clever with the effects however boring most of the time!) What a selection!!!

If you want to go, check if all the rides are opened and don't rock up thinking they will all be open. There are no signs saying so anyway! Be prepared to pay a heavy price to get in and, when it is dry, DO THE OUTDOOR RIDES!!!

I guess I was there on a bad day, however, I was sad and disappointed with the rides... If the park is ever to be as good as America, there is a lot of improvement to do, Universal!! Or maybe just stick to the states for a good-ol rollercoaster.

p.s. Let's see if they really read the reviews properly. Don't say in your response, ""Nonetheless, we trust you had an enjoyable time and will be back soon"" this will be interesting.....

We took a taxi to get there, from our hotel in the city it cost SGD$15. Entrance to the park was SGD$76, but if you book online you can do it for SGD$68. I've been here before, and as with any theme park, queues can be long. So we took the Universal Express pass for $40. It allows you to get to the ride immediately, but on this pass, only once per ride. You can buy the Universal Express unlimited for $70 to get as many Express entries per ride as you need, but we couldn't justify the cost. As it turned out, the once only pass was ample. That's because we arrive dwhen the park opened (Thursday, 10am) and hardly anyone was there. So we went on the roller coasters etc. When the ""normal"" queues were short, it was less than a couple minutes wait.

But it rained just as soon as we arrived, and for about 1 hour the coasters were closed due to lightning. That was Ok, there was plenty else to see and do.

Our top 4 favourite rides, in order, were: 1. Cylon roller coaster, 2. Transformers ride, 3. Human roller coaster, 4. The Mummy.
There are also tons of things for kids to do and if you go with your family you will totally enjoy it.

For us, we did it all in 4.5 hours, concentrating on the coasters, which we did 4x each. Yes, we are the big kids. We had tons of fun, but the heat of the day wore us out quickly. We had lunch at the diner in Hollywood, which is an award winning restaurant. My signature fish & chips were great. Probably the best meal I had on my week in Singapore.

USS lies on sentosa island, amd you should buy a 3-1 ticket to visit SEA aquarium as well as maritime museum. And one of the tip is that, you must buy an express ticket. I'm sure about that an dyou dont waste money because it's always crowded even weekdays. You will be waiting up to 2-3 hours for a ride, so crazy. Express ticket is a must. There are many areas,  but my family loves madagascar and mummy revenge.. very suitable for children. Personally, im a fan of Transformer ride, it's amazing short film.. You can take some special food to the parks, just explain to them. Moreover, there are many food stalls offering fast food, so expensive.. but it's good. Other tip is bringing the raincoat if you dont want buy a pack of that, or like a wet cat. Raincoat is truly necessary for the lost world ride where you are splashed. When use the locker @attractions, pls remember the time they start to charge. If you want to play 2 times, go and get the stuff out and put it again or you lose your money.
Remember to get the flyer of show and event schedule, very important... if you plan well, you are able to watch and play all ride, street shows, and events. One of my favorite part is taking photo with characters around the park, there are many be 10-13 different characters.

Airing on the side of caution as we often do, we packed some gluten free food into our day bag as we could not get any information prior to our visit on whether the park would be able to provide gluten free food. Having such a serious allergy makes it difficult to buy food to eat on a day out. 
We got into the queue and started the normal bag search, where the female member of staff told us that we were not allowed to take in any food or drink. We tried to explain that the food was for medical reasons and one of us would still be purchasing food from the site. Despite this she made us empty our bag and throw it in the bin or eat it (we had just had breakfast so were not particularly hungry) or we would not be allowed into the park. We took this argument to the ticket office and were met with the same response and told that we would be able to find food in the park.
 
We trusted these members of staff and duly threw away our food, entered and proceeded to have a great morning. It was then lunch time, and we started in the Jurassic area in search of some suitable food. NOTHING! We then tried every other area and restaurant and even showed our gluten free food card in each to which we were met with the same response; they were not able to offer us any gluten free food and our only choice was if we wanted food we would have to leave the site.
 
By this point we were extremely hungry and decided to leave. This experience severely tarnished our experience at the park and considering that it is 2017, Universal Studios need to quickly address their policies on taking food into the park or sort their menus out.

- Bawa air minum sendiri. Paling tidak bawa botol aqua. Jangan kuatir kehabisan. Banyak dispenser kran air siap minum. Bisa dipakai untuk refill ke botol minum Anda.
- Datang lebih pagi agar bisa explore atau puas foto-foto sebelum siang. Ketika siang apalagi weekend, ramainya luar biasa. Mau foto aja harus ngantri.
- Belilah kartu Universal Express. Harganya 50 SGD. Dengan kartu ini Anda bisa langsung masuk ke sebagian besar wahana tanpa harus mengantri. Percayalah, Anda akan bersyukur jika membeli kartu Express, saat Anda melihat panjangnya antrian di wahana-wahana favorit! Kecuali Anda mau berdiri 30 menit lebih di setiap wahana untuk mengantri.
- Pakailah pakaian yang cepat kering, dan sepatu yang juga cepat kering. Beberapa wahana ada basah-basahnya (saya terpaksa tetap memakai sepatu saya walaupun basah tersiram di wahana Lost World). Ada sih tempat pengeringan baju dan sepatu, seperti hairdyer raksasa gitu, tapi ya harus bayar beberapa SGD. Hehehe...Kalau pakai sandal, nantinya harus dilepas saat naik Rollercoaster (mungkin takut lepas trus nyangkut di mesin kali ya, bisa fatal)",Ingin Kembali Lagi !,2017-09-01,FRIENDS,alabaster87,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jakarta,Indonesia,1

Secondly, get the express pass, it's worth the money. There are two express passes, the one time use ( cheaper) and the unlimited ( about $20 more). You will save a whole lot of waiting time since sometimes you may have to wait for up to an hour in the regular line. We took the unlimited, but barely managed to go on any rides more than once.
Start with the transformers, then the mummy, then go on to the Galactica (in the Cylon, you will not know what hit you while the Human is better). The lost world is a lot of fun, but you will get wet, so get  ponchos or purchase them from the cart outside. Also, wear sandals / flip flops and avoid sneakers, coz they will definitely get wet. After these, don't miss the Shrek, Puss in Boots and may be Madagascar ride. 
You should watch the Waterworld show, and if you sit right in front, you will get wet. So you can re-use your poncho, or just enjoy it and dry up later in the dry pods outside.
If you want to get good pics with the universal studios globe, you need to be there early, or else you will have half the people around you in your pic! 
Also, make sure you complete all the rides and only then spend time visiting the stores or taking pictures, otherwise you will NOT have time to complete it. 
Once we finished with the studios, we took the Sentosa Express( which you get on just outside the gate) straight to Beach station (you don't need to buy a ticket, it's free) where we bought premium tickets (not needed, you can save your money and buy the standard ones) for the Wings of Time show.

Having heard a lot about the place before coming here had already raised the expectations quite a lot. We had planned to visit on a Monday thinking that we will avoid the peak crowd of the weekend. But to our surprise the place was extremely crowded. However I must say the entire staff and systems are well geared up to handle the crowd. All the rides and shows are truly unique and worth the experience. 

A few advices from our learnings - 

1. Reach before Universal Studios opens so target to reach by 9:30 AM
2. If you are ok with travelling in buses take the bus to sentosa as Monorail is generally more crowded and may delay your arrival to Sentosa. You can always use monorail to come back as all ride from Sentosa to Singapore are free. Buses cost 1 dollar per person compared to 5 dollars per person by monorail. 
3. Even if you are traveling on a weekday don't forget to take the express pass else you will miss out on many rides waiting in the queue.

En total con el pase ilimitado la entrada sale cara, pero es la única forma de aprovechar el parque y montar varias veces en las atracciones.

El parque es similar a otros de Warner, Universal o Disney, dividido en zonas y cada una suele tener una o dos atracciones 'fuertes'.

Si llueve (como en nuestro caso, al final de la tarde), hay varias zonas y atracciones cubiertas como la de 'Transformers' o la de 'La Momia' que pueden seguir usándose.

That said the Waterworld show was excellent and we both thought the Transformer ride was fantastic.

First was the long queues, where it said 35 min was actually 50 min, unlike other theme parks where there is a entertainment or things to read whilst you queue, it was sadly lacking here.

If you wanted a fast pass it was the same price as the ticket or even dearer for an unlimited one so a family of 4 would be 720 Singapore dollars, in my view £420 for a day out is a little steep.

The Waterworld show was good, the hour wait for the Mummy ride to see that only one lane was working was frustrating, we all thought the Transformer ride was spectacular and you could see the difference with this new ride and what I would say are some of the old rides.

Everywhere there was a photo opportunity you had to queue so a universal photographer could take your photo, and no characters strolling round like other parks.

I think the icing on the cake for me was being stopped going on the Cylon rollercoaster because I had 4 x 20 dollar bills in my pocket, I had already gone and stood in the locker queue twice because they refused me admittance with my glasses case in my zipped up pocket and then scanned me again and said the money was a safety risk

Tips
If you can afford to buy the express pass. It cuts the waiting out and in the heat it can be painful. We had been on every ride (including Jurassic park twice; the Mummy three times, transformers twice) before 6pm. Save up and buy this pass you will thank me! 

The two Battlestar gallatica roller coasters you have to put your stuff in a locker, same for the Mummy. 

The lockers by Jurassic park are a nightmare. Use the ones in sci-fi city or by the Mummy (there are two) where you can get 45 min free or just pay for them.

Some street stalls sell bottles of Dasani (3:50) water at half the cost of Evian ($6:50) so look out for them.

The Jurassic park canopy roller coaster isn't great and often has long lines.

De attracties zijn echt leuk! Voor zowel jong en oud. Ik heb gegierd van plezier in de sesamestreet ride (die eigenlijk bedoeld is voor kinderen die nog naar Sesamstraat kijken) , mijn adrenaline level schoot door het dak in de battlestar galactica achtbaan en mijn oog voor detail had het meer dan naar haar zin in de Madagascar attractie (prachtig gemaakt!). 

Er is echt voor ieder wat wils en dat maakt het zo leuk! Waarom dan toch maar 3 sterren? Dat heeft te maken met de ruimte voor verbetering die er is in de totale publieksbeleving:
- schoonmaak van de horeca terrasjes die er zijn laat te wensen over
- opzet in de horeca gelegenheden is inefficiënt en hierdoor ontstaan er lange wachtrijen die niet nodig zijn
- bij de achtbanen moet je tas in een kluisje, hierna moet/kun je deze weer ophalen, dit proces is omslachtig

Maar al met al een topdag gehad! 
Als het druk is in het park op de dag dat je er bent: schaf dan een express pas aan! Dan kun je zo doorlopen bij de attracties (maximale wachttijd voor ons gisteren was 20 minuten) en kun je alles in 1 dag doen. Tip: schaf deze pas direct aan bij de ingang, als je dit in het park doet betaal je meer. Het is het echt meer dan waard!

1,515811392,2017-08-21,MOBILE,5,"What a great day the 4 of us had at Universal Studios today 2 adults and 2 children 12 & 10).

We got there early (9am) to buy our tickets (as had no chance to do so in advance).

Universal itself doesn't open until 10am, however once you've purchased your tickets you then form an orderly que to then get in.

Tips:
1). Definitely consider purchasing the 'express' tickets as we did. We only went for the single express (fast track) tickets (1 per ride) versus the multiple, and that was enough, as cost will then go up. You can still take as many rides on each attraction as you like but you'll have to que after using your 1 express option.
2). Go to the rides you want to most take early/first and DONT use your express, save these for later.
3). Food in Universal itself looked pretty average and is VERY expensive for what it is. Instead eat outside of Universal in the wider Sentosa complex as there are good places like Toast Box where the food is good and MUCH more reasonable.
4). Whilst we didn't, you can get your hand stamped to go outside of Universal itself during the day and then go back in and continue going on the attractions. This way you can eat in the wider Sentosa complex (as 3 above)
5).  The locker facilities are good at Universal, however it's a bit of a free for all so be sure to hold your ground!!. Most of the themed areas offer free locker services for a period of 45 mins, after which you are charged, however NOT all, for example The Lost World wanted to charge you so instead we walked back to Ancient Egypt's lockers (free) to lock our stuff away.
6). Dependant upon age of children and their level of adrenaline, be sure to research in advance the rides you want to go on so you plot your day accordingly. Whilst your waiting for the park to open at 10am, there are maps available for you to plan your strategy.

Not being much of a ride person I actually found it a really good day out and get and very well payed out and we all had a thoroughly enjoyable day, not leaving until 4:30pm.",Great day at Universal,2017-08-01,FAMILY,1sacha_deal,"Brentwood, United Kingdom",Brentwood,United Kingdom,1

The amount of rides,shows and eateries is incredible. This place has grown so much in popularity that there are thousands of people meaning long waits for rides. Some rides are so good that they are definitely worth the wait. I'm not sure I'd wait 2 hours for a ride though. There is always the priority pass meaning you get to line up in a significantly shorter line so as to avoid long queues.  Be aware that this doesn't apply to all rides. The food and drink is quite expensive in the grounds so you might want to bring your own in. A certain water 750ml water bottle sets you back 5 USD which is insane. The park is definitely well equipped and caters for the high demand of locals and tourists that visit this place on a daily basis.

Plenty of rides which I am sure everyone knows. What amazes me most is the way they are able to handle that amount of people coming into the park. The place is well managed with friendly staff all over the place.
An advice for those who are really into rides is the get an express ticket way before the day itself. The express tickets works on a very simple demand and supply curve. Hence booking earlier will get you a better price. I made a mistake and brought it that day itself as I wanted to observe the crowd first. Bad mistake, I ended up paying $70 per pax when I could have gotten at $50 ( express , per ride one time only) I heard if you book way much earlier, you could get it for $30 only.

- Take a map with you to ensure you cover all areas
- All main attractions will have queue with a min wait time of 30-40 mins
- Water world show happens at 3PM and 7 PM so plan your tour accordingly
- The following roller coaster rides requires strong body and mind

Having read reviews previously we were a little reluctant to part with our hard-earned cash but we got discounted e-tickets which we purchased online the day before. Having been to Universal Orlando before, this simply doesn't compare. The rides aren't as thrilling and there is much less to do. However,  it was a fun way to pass the morning and would recommend doing if you have a few hours to spare. As mentioned by other reviewers, it was very crowded and queues were huge. We got there at 9.30 and the queues were already 20 or so deep at the turnstiles. We planned our rides carefully and did the most popular ones first. We also used single rider which really cut down our queue time. If you are not careful, you can easily part with lots of cash - going over on locker time, food, drinks, souvenirs (all of which are over-priced) but we didn't actually spend anything other than the admission fee. We also took the  opportunity to explore Sentosa Island and took the free shuttle bus to Fort Siloso (free admission and great for the history of the island) and the beach. All in all a good day out if your expectations aren't too high and you are careful with your spending.

The lines are quite long (1-2 hrs for the major rides), which makes the Express pass quite attractive, although it does cost more than the entry fee, so it’s very expensive. Universal could learn a lot by looking at Disney Florida’s fast pass system which is significantly cheaper and works much better.
The other issue is the park don’t seem to do anything about queue jumpers, of which there are plenty, this obviously adds to the queuing time for those who do line up patiently. And while you are queuing up, prepare to have your personal space not just invaded, but violated.
The park itself is well maintained, well themed and generally enjoyable, although small.  Many of the attractions are copy/paste from Florida, but we can forgive that as they’re great fun.

0,514182500,2017-08-17,OTHER,4,"It is like any other famous attractions you visit around the world, there is one thing you cannot avoid for sure - crowds. Yes you heard me, there will be many patrons here in the afternoon, but your own experience may vary depending on which day you visit.

It is recommended that you avoid peak periods such as school holidays, public holidays or weekends. Rides can take up to 110 minutes of waiting time, if you are not comfortable with that, get an express pass to queue in a faster lane which can reduce lots of waiting time.

I visited on a Wednesday morning at 10am, when the park opens. There are lots of people queuing at the gates already so we went straight to the more popular rides to avoid the crowd later on.

First, we went on the Battlestar Galactica roller coaster. There are two different rides for this single attraction and usually the Cyclon ride is more popular. We went here first , with an express ride the waiting time was around 10 minutes.

The park is not super huge so we roughly spent around 50 minutes in each theme park including waiting time. For me personally I recommend the Transformers 4D Ride, Revenge of the Mummy and Battlestar Galactica which is phenomenal. Not forgetting the WaterShow at 1pm, 3pm and 7pm,the actors and gun show is amazing.

You can go on rides at 5pm onwards for lesser waiting time as people start to eat dinner, or go very early like me and visit the popular rides first. There are sheltered areas for most attractions with air conditionals and big fans to reduce the heat. Also do drink up lots of water, the weather is quite hot so they have different water filling points for you.

Some rides require you to put your personal belongings into a locker, free for 85 minutes and thereafter there will be a small charge depending on your usage times.

Overall, its a great place for you to visit if you come to Singapore, a must not miss! Whether you come with a family,with kids,with your partner or even alone(yes there are lanes for single riders!)

If you plan on taking your family or friends just try to get the pass, the best thing you can get with the pass is to try the rides about a dozen of times! - Now more importantly i would recommend every ride at the studio but one of my certain favorites is the transformers
, and mummy ride. Both of them have amazing features and can blow your mind in about an instant.

If you would just like to try every ride, i would suggest to try some with low wait times you can try contacting or meeting the (manager) for further information.

The park is super easy to get to using public transport.

There is only two big rollercoasters which is disappointing given its universal and you expect more, but the mummy ride kinda saves the day as it is brilliant. 

Prices once in the park are a bit on the highside. $6/7 for a drink (including water) which I feel is a little high, especially given the heat.

 Parköffnung um 10 Uhr, wir waren gegen 11:00 dort.

Wir kauften 2 Tickets am Sentosa Schalter für76 SGD pro Erwachsenen und eines für ein Kind 56$.

Anders wie in Florida gibt es zwei Arten von Expresstickets; die abhängig davon wie voll es ist billiger oder teurer werden, unglaublich!
Den express Zuschlag gibt es ab 30$.

Heute wäre der einfache express Zuschlag 70$ /Ticket gewesen, eine absolute Frechheit!

Mit einem davon kann man an den Top-Attraktionen nur 1x an der Warteschlange vorbei, mit dem zweiten  kann man unlimitiert an den Warteschlangen vorbei, natürlich noch teurer.

Uns war es zu teuer.

Als wir dann in Richtung des Einlass gingen traute ich meinen Augen nicht, Warteschlangen vor den Eingängen ohne Ende.
Bei der ersten Achterbahn battleship galactica mussten wir 2 Stunden warten, die human ist langweilig, die  cyclon ist super.

Hauptgrund für die exorbitanten Wartezeiten ist, das die Express Kunden unverhältnismäßig bevorzugt werden 3-4 komplette Achterbahnen wurden komplett nur durch express Kunden bestückt, um dann jede 3. oder 4.
durch Normalzahler zu befüllen, tolles System.

Man wird als Kunde 3. Klasse behandelt, dass geht ja gar nicht.

1,513622910,2017-08-16,OTHER,5,"I traveled to Universal Studios on a Saturday with my wife and our 10 month old baby. We reached at around 11 AM and stood in line for a baby stroller for about half an hour-so ideally, our time in Universal started from 11.45 AM.
We still managed to take the desired rides, have lunch, dinner and a snack time packed in between and had sometime left to relax. Here's how we did it.

1. We had downloaded the RWS (Resorts World Sentosa) app. The amusement park provides free Wifi-the app shows approximate waiting times for each of the individual rides. Try doing the rides with low wait times during the early hours.

2. For the popular rides (like Transformers: The Ride), there would be a very high wait time for most of the day (Battlestar Galactica:Human had a consistent wait time of 130 mins). However, the wait times would reduce as the day progresses, 
which is kind of obvious-because people would most probably not enter the park post lunch-they would all try to come in early to make the most of the day. You can try these rides in the afternoon. Transformers: The Ride had a wait time of 2 hours till 5 pm but then-it started reducing 
until it became 10 mins post 7 pm. I did the ride 2 times on loop (and you must not miss this ride) in 15 mins.

3. Popular rides also have the option of a single rider entry-meaning that if you go in alone, you will be accomodated when there is an empty seat. This line is relatively smaller. For optimal results, try popular rides in the single rider queue towards the end of the day. I tried Transformers in a single rider entry at 4 pm while my wife was holding the baby outside. Then I came back, held the baby and my wife went in.

4. Lunch hours are a rush at the eateries. It's difficult to get yourself seated-more so if it is raining outside. Non-lunch hours would be the best to refill yourselves. Lunch hours ideally can be used to try out some rides-which are expected to be a bit light during that half an hour-1 hour window.

5. We had heard that we could skip ticketing queues if we book our tickets online. However, almost everyone books online these days, so that is no longer a useful hack. The bag screening procedure would anyways be a tedious and lengthy one. I do not know if we were lucky but suddenly at around 11.15 AM, they stopped screening bags and started letting everyone go in just like that.

1,512928716,2017-08-14,OTHER,4,"We visited as a family with two teenage daughters on a Monday in August. I recommend:
(i) Buy an express ticket which allows you to get onto the rides quicker. I regard the  standard ticket entry as near worthless because you end up spending most of your day lined up in queues waiting for the big rides (and hate yourself for being tight on buying the 'cheapest' ticket). For a Monday not during a Singaporean holiday, the line ups were horrendous: 180 mins for the Transformers ride only 2 hours into our visit. You will simply spend most of your day lining up without an express ticket.
(ii) Arrive by 9am. If you are like us and bought your ticket online, you have to bring a long the PAPER print out of the ticket confirmation AND your CREDIT CARD that you paid online with. Line up first at the Guest Services counter (left hand side immediately before the entrance to the park) where you exchange your paperwork for the real ticket entry.
(iii) for express ticket holders: line up in the left hand queue at park entrance. Look for the line up labelled ""Priority"". If you begin your line up early in the day you'll enter the park nearly first.
(iv) when gates open do the big rides first (BattleShip Galactica: Transformers: or Revenge of the Mummy). They are all good. If you get to the line up first you won't need to immediately use your express ticket as the wait time is 0 mins! 
(v) if you're into planning: download the park map and know your directions to the big rides before you arrive.
(vi)  By midday even with an express pass the line ups become horrendous and you'll probably be giving up on the main rides. Do the indoor stuck during the hottest part of the day: Shrek 4D adventure, Lights Camera Action are both indoors and a good respite from the heat.
(vii) eat well before entering park or take your own lunch: Food outlets are crazily overpriced. bring your own water.
(viii) whatever day you visit expect hordes of people after midday

The merchandise prices were simply exorbitant compared to U.S prices and killed the whole experience.

If you can afford it I would highly recommend buying the fast track tickets as it seemed the rides worked by normal queue one ride and then fast track next ride. A lot of people buy the fast track as well so you still can be waiting up to 15-20 minutes to get on a ride.

The most annoying thing is the locker system - they will not let you take on anything to the bigger rides so you have to put them into lockers.

We went on a Thursday thinking it might not be too busy, how wrong could we be hahaha 

We also went on a day where the weather wasn't supposed to be amazing (risk
Of storm) was the only day we had free. All of the rides stopped for safety reasons which is understandable due to thunder and lightening for about 2 hours) But the horrible thing was we had just lined up in a 90+min line only to be told the ride was stopped (about 10 people from the front of the line there is not the most adequate amount of shelter, bring an umberella or poncho ;) or on a hot day make sure u have adequate sun protection :) 

Tips:

*Bring cash, most of the food stands are cash only including games etc 
*we bought our tickets online (you will need the original PDF or printout not a screenshot of the email zoomed in this seemed to hold the line up a little at times)
*Pay the extra for the line jumper express pass!!! Seems it's weight in gold and our biggest mistake that we didn't do it
*the money changer is just outside the gates to the right at the shop there if u need to change $ do so there 
*there are 2 ATMs in the park so it seems they are side by side which seems just crazy considering the size of the park. 
*hire a Locker! Or nominate the non rider person to leave valuables with as you cannot have mobiles, hats, sunnies, change in Pockets or any other loose items, some of the rides even scan u with metal detectors it's not worth lining up unless u are free of such items (freee for first 45 mins then approx $2-4 per hour? Max of $20 per day) 
*check yourself the height of your child etc on the height requirements level things at each ride entry, as the staff don't all seem to Check and we saw LOTS of parents with grumpy kids turned around. 
*be prepared for wait times they are lengthy. And well hidden!!! Rides don't look too busy then boom ..... giant winding lines with stairs etc.

There are so many terrible things about this place it is hard to know where to start. Perhaps the whole concept - where they build attractions (rides) that must be stopped when there is bad weather and the risk of thunder and lightening... maybe someone should have factored in the weather stats in Singapore - with almost 200 days of rain annually - this means that the chances of being stuck in queue hell for hours are very high as they stop all operations waiting for the weather to clear. We experienced this twice -waiting for a total of almost 4 hours in long queues and weather stops for the pleasure of one 30 second ride which was over almost before it had begun. Perhaps a Dome over the whole complex may have been a smart idea - as the way it is now - you are at the mercy of the Singapore's fickle weather. 
That would be my next complaint - the length of the rides... after queuing for up for  most of your day - the rides you wait so expectantly for are more often than not a terrible anticlimax and because the park is so small they are very short in length. 
Another delightful element is the whole concept of the express ticket - this is really fantastic as you wait often for hours in queues with almost imperceptible movement and you have the added pleasure of watching streams of smug express ticket holders casually strolling past you in another line. This does wonders for the moral of all the regular plebs who have paid an already size-able chunk of their pay packet to be there. This system is incredibly annoying and just adds a type of aggressive energy to the masses. Just charge one price and put a gate limit on how many visitors who can enter the park in one day, Is it really fair to expect people to wait for 160 minutes for one ride? 
Anything positive? Yep - some of the design within the park is nice to look at but this place is seriously overcrowded and it was such an annoying and frustrating experience that I would literally pay to avoid it.

Good:
I was impressed with the cleanliness and presentation of the park. The layout was easy to navigate and the rides catered to a range of age groups. The rides were pretty good, and the transformers ride was state of the art.

The bad:
Extremely busy. I've been to six theme parks now and this was the busiest I've ever been to. It was a Monday, granted it was school holidays, but it was just insane, to the point where the spectacle quickly fades and you just get annoyed at the place. The workers were clearly worn down from hours of dealing with the visitors - so much different to a Disney park where they are polite and happy even if they're dying inside.

The ugly: This park is a money making factory - patrons in, spend spend spend, patrons out. We didn't get the express pass and after seeing what people paid for them we are glad. We got into the park for $67 each and I'm so glad we didn't pay more because we only got onto 5 rides. The wait times posted are guesswork at best - we waited in some 20 minute lines for over an hour, watching all the express pass visitors move past in a continuous line. It's honestly soul destroying. Disney have this system down to an art with fast pass, universal need to do some serious work to be on par.

The prices of drink and food are atrocious. Expect to pay triple, even quadruple for everything. You can exit the park and grab something to eat from the nearby food court and get back in - do this to save some coin.

All in all, we wish we'd done something else with our day. It was just too busy and too commercialised to be any fun. Kids will love it, adults not so much.","Well presented, terribly executed.",2017-08-01,COUPLES,callumm644,"Wellington, New Zealand",Wellington,New Zealand,0

0,510616105,2017-08-09,OTHER,5,"Here's my general tips - so many people miss this for some reason? Btw, I would rate myself as a 2 for theme parks (1 being never visited a good theme park, 5 being theme park enthusiast all around the world, visited more than one USS)

Best rides in my opinion:

1.) Transformers
2.) Mummy (love the surprise after the bugs! hahahaa)
3.) Cyclon
4.) Human
5.) Rapids
6.) Shrek (it hurt my neck and back though during the horsy ride :( Do be careful! )

1.) Do not go on a weekend, or holiday. I went on a Monday, no holidays, and yet the queue is insane (for the regular) - the Cyclon ride had a 2 hr wait time, 45 minutes for Express. Visited on July 3, but remember, you don't get to see fireworks. Maybe try going on a Tuesday instead? 

2.) Do get the express, I was immediately in front for most rides. Do take note that there is ride there that does not accept express (the one near Jurassic, 4 people) Canopy flyer I think (protip sit at the one facing back for surprises LOL). I took the $50 - one time ride for everything. I wasn't able to use all items, I wish there was a way I could research. Did they have an increase recently? I paid $50 for my express, but I see a comment below stating $70? (that's already unli during my time)

3.) Be there early. Like WTF, I was there at 10AM and the line was already waaay long with multiple columns, but thankfully the staff opened more lines. :) I was in by 10:15 and the queue for Transformers was already two hours (it's worth it though! Also, I got the express pass and I was immediately first) You kinda feel bad for all those people you pass at the regular queue. Be there by 9AM then. You may take pics with the globe, but I recommend doing that later in the day before you go home ;)

Most of the queuing areas were under shade, have fans and sometimes air conditioning. This was a nice touch as most queues were minimum of 30 minutes. I liked that you could join some rides as a 'single rider' which occasionally cut your queue time down, although this was dependant on how many people were also doing it. It was annoying that you couldn't do this on the cylon or human, there were often 2 or 3 empty seats on a car which already had a small amount of seats to begin with.
The option to buy an 'express pass' (for an extra $50 ish) is a horrible idea aimed at wealthier people to literally push in front of people who have already payed possibly $65 + already to get into the park, this also increases the queue times. Money = privilege as always.

3,510308887,2017-08-08,MOBILE,1,"Visited Monday 7th August. Horrendously busy, had standard tickets and arrived at 11am.  Massive queues to get in and had taken a day off to take my teenage niece as visiting from overseas. 

Asked about express pass, $70 for one time use at selected rides or $100 for unlimited, chose the latter thinking that would be best value.....how wrong could one be, biggest mistake was actually going in on such a busy day. Universal Studios Singapore (USS) can decide how much to charge depending on how popular the day is!! I suggest to USS that you charge more for quieter days and not for busy days as it's a complete rip off, huge disappointment for my niece. We elected to do what many trip-advisors recommend, visit the biggest most popular rides first. 

Well!! I would have expected an extremely expensive ""unlimited"" upgrade to get you on the rides a couple of time during the day, absolutely not possible, unless you want to forget doing any of the other park venues. All queue times in Express lane! Transformers queue time 45mins. Cylon queue time 55mins. Mummy queue time 30 mins. Human queue time advised as 45mins, took 1 hour 25 mins and from the bottom of the stairs to the ride, the standard queue people passed us, infuriating and the ride staff not interested despite many Express queue people complaining.  

Now, consider the waiting time above is 3 hours 35 mins, for 4 rides (EXPRESS!!) add in going to lockers as you cannot take any bag or loose article or phone on these rides and you get to about 4 hours. Then add in several of the other rides, some of which you cannot use Express pass, and we did none of the junior rides, add in  shows .... and a sore point....queuing for Shrek 4D where someone had opened a rope at the door and everyone had gone into the Express entrance....lack of personnel (one at main entrance and one inside so no control) all of the above has waiting time, allow a 25min stop for lunch at 3pm (expensive and poor value for money at KT Grill) and we find ourselves up to 640pm and no second ride at any of them as not enough time before Waterworld show at 7pm. We then only had time for Lights, Camera, Action before everything stopped at 8pm. 

In all, just two of us with Express passes, with short lunch stop, did the following rides and shows from 11am-8pm with no second rides:

1. Transformers
2. Cylon
3. Mummy
4. Human
5. Canopy flyer 
6. Rapids
7. A Crate Adventure
8. Lights camera action
9. Shrek 
10. Donkey
11. Waterworld. 

So if you think you want to do all these and more on a busy day, think carefully about the unlimited pass as not worth it and possibly buy the one time express pass, cannot imagine how miserable the people in the standard queue felt after their day.

0,509630671,2017-08-07,OTHER,4,"This is a great theme park but a few things stop it getting a 5 star, which I'll explain later.  We took an Uber to the Casino drop off point (inside a big car park) and from there there is a simple escalator to Sentosa.  It saves costs getting across to the island and is a quick way in.
Once off the escalator you are at the entrance to USS.  If you have tickers then join the queue else visit a yello ticketing booth.  The queues may be long but they move quite quickly.  It is expensive and costs about 350USD for two adults and three kids aged 12 and under.  What was really expensive was the express upgrade which was 100USD per head, so much more than the actual ticket price.  So 850USD later we entered the park.
It is really well laid out in a big circle split into a number of different zones.  There aren't a massive number of rides but enough to spend a good day here.  
In the AM, the queues were ridiculous, up to 110 minutes for some of the most popular rides and even with the express tickets it was up to 20 minutes.  The guys checking entry to the express lanes often exaggerated the wait times though, often saying 40 minutes when it was really 20.
After 3 o'clock the queues were much shorter and most of the time you could walk straight to the front with the express ticket and even the standard ticket queues weren't too long.
The quality of the rides is good and my favourite was Transformers, followed by the Ceylon ride (Battlestar Galactica grey loop - the red Human one wasn't so good), then the Mummy.  The rapids was also quite well done.
We managed to do all of the rides, some 3 times, in one day.
There are so many rest rooms, ice cream and drink stops and eateries but dond't surprised to have to pay 16USD for a hotdog.  Most queues have water fountains and there are plenty of places to top up your water bottles, which you must take!
Several of the thrill rides do not allow any bags, wallets or phones and they do provide lockers, free for the first 35 minutes or so.
Make sure you visit the Spielberg movie set which simulates a hurricane, this was excellent and is right near the entrance.
I do feel that it is a little expensive and they probably sell too many tickets in the AM as the queues were too long.  I would maybe consider heading straight to the opposite side of the park and doing some of the less busy rides in the AM, saving the thrill rides for the PM when the queues are smaller.
There is a free monorail back to the mainland, but we took the monorail to Imbiah and got the cable car back to harbour front, which was fun, but again not cheap.  We did have a great day.",USS with 3 kids,2017-08-01,FAMILY,rearcardoor,"Northampton, United Kingdom",Northampton,United Kingdom,1

1. Make sure you don't go on a Singapore Holiday or school break. 
2. Go on a Monday or Tuesday

Their website talks about express entry however when you get there you have to que again out side guest services to get your tickets and then que again to be let into the park so there's no express entry. Our friends you just turned up on the day and bought at the kiosk got faster service. 

I had bought a ticket groom headout.com for my 3 year old.  My mistake as she didn't need one.  I was told this when I got to guest services at universal studios. They couldn't give me a refund as they had accidentlu already printed the ticket. They asked me not to use the ticket and speak with headout.com 

I'm fortunately headout.com say they can't do anything and universal studios Singapore arnt getting back to my emails. 

So the moral of the story is just buy your tickets on the door.  It works out cheaper and quicker. 

The rides were good and out small children enjoyed it.  We bought express line upgrades which we used a little however these upgrades are really useful for the bigger rides that really small children wont enjoy.
Saying that queuing in a normal que can be brutal for some rides.

The western style food was poor. In Mel's dinner there was no vegetarian option amongst the burgers. In a city what is supposed to be international and culturally diverse and also has some great eating options at such a competitive price Mel's dinner in universal studios is a real let down!! Please provide a vegetarian option. 

The rides are good. Buy your ticket at the door. Consider the express pass if your kids are over 7 or 7 and want to go on the bigger rides. Try yo leave the complex and go out side for lunch (there s lots of good cheaper options just outside) if you must eat inside try one of oriental style food courts in the lost world area.",Good but requires some improvement in service,2017-08-01,FAMILY,Amit P,"London, United Kingdom",London,United Kingdom,1

If you go in the ""Cyclone"" don´t do it just after breakfast. It´s a really powerful roller coaster, scary but good fun. 
In terms of queues expect avarage of 40 minutes on a weekend. I bought the ""express card"" for $80 at 10 am and I was basically jumping in and out attractions without waiting. The price changes as per demand, so the sooner you get it, the better.
At Jurasic Park you´ll probably get your shoes wet. There´s a coin operator drying station but you can also go to a toilet and use the machine for drying hands. Leave your shoes there a few minutes and you´ll be ready to go in no time.
Most attractions that involve sudden movements require you to leave all your belongings in a locker. There seemed to be lots of confusion on how to use them. THis is what you do:

- Go to where the lockers are and use of the computers there. Select ""Rent locker"".
- You´ll see a place where to put your finger. Use your thumb once or twice (check what the screen tells you) and once your fingerprints are stored, the computer will assign you a locker. 
- Locate that locker, put all inside, and close it holding it for 3 seconds till you hear the actual locking mechanism.
- Go and have fun.
- Once you are done, go to any computer at the locker place and select ""Open locker"". You don´t need to remember your locker number. Once you put your finger again, it´ll recognise your fingerprints, open the locker and show you on the screen your locker number. That´s all, locate it and clear it. There is no cost for the first 40 minutes.
- At Jurasic Parc, lockers are not free.

I like the idea of them having a special queue for single riders. This shortened my waiting time for popular rides by a good 10-20mins!

but you know.. if you haven't been to hollywood's or been a while since you've been to hollywood, this place is still a great place to visit. 

I skipped waterworld stunt show as that show's been around since as long as i can remember and have seen it so many times already. but it's a good show for those who havent seen it yet.

I enjoyed the transformers ride, i didn't think i would like it having hated the michael bay movie franchise, but i really did, 

and so is the puss and boots roller coaster.

 the mummy ride is so old now as it's been around since forever in UShollywood. still fun to ride with the old mummy franchise with imhotep and not the ton cruise version! 

The shrek 4d, they need to calibrate the projector for ""mirror on the wall"" on the pre show section of the attraction. the 3d movie itself is pretty dated now. the animation is pretty choppy by today's standards. maybe it is time to update with a new 4d feature.

Sesame Street show, it features Bigbird, Ernie, Bert, COokie Monster, Elmo, and abby cadabby (debuted in 2006) doing some song and dance. and i enjoyed it so much. 

FAST PASS. NO NEED to get a fast pass. Just go to the park on a weekday, and choose the ride that matters the most. Just be patient with the queue.

And by 6.30pm, you can pretty much go into any ride in the park with zero wait time. from 6.30 to 8:00 i was able to go to the mummy ride twice, the car ride once, the madagascar boat ride once, transformer twice.. and got into the final show of Shrek 4d. 

Also needs to update the studio set attraction. Spielberg does not look that young anymore

Food: Food in the park is what you expect. higher than normal prices, but they're not prohibitive. especially if you are able to get one of those food vouchers, then the food becomes really reasonably priced. 

Warning: the park becomes VERY EXPENSIVE if you bring in children. The place is pretty much one giant toy store. Kids and toy stores equals empty pockets for you and me. 

In Summary, it's Universal Studios, folks! it may be much smaller than US's theme park, but it can still be so much fun for everyone.

3,506088777,2017-07-27,MOBILE,1,"Ok so I vowed that I would never post a negative review on here but this was such a dissapointing experience I have to warn everyone about it;

I planned on purchasing the express pass once inside the park as advertised on the website ( extra $30.00 )... As a taveller I only brought enough cash with me to the park to cover the passes + food.

When I got to the park entrance they informed me the express pass was instead going to be an extra $70.00 each due to 'dynamic pricing' (wtf?!)...

We had no option but for me and my 13yr old daughter to go with regular passes instead and wait in line...

When I say 'wait in line' I meant we were at the park for about 6 hours, only got to go on about 6 mediocre kiddie style rides which lasted about 2-3min each (actually) - spending the rest of the time sweltering in the ridiculous heat - until my daughter finally gave up & decided we would have more fun back at the hotel pool.

Okay so the fact that I didnt bring more cash to the park is totally my fault, and I accept this, but there is more to this story...

The waiting times posted at the gate to each ride... Even the mediocre rides stated a 30min+ wait time throughout the day which actually means a 60min+ waiting time to go on a ride designed for 9yr olds... 

Really dissapointed as the only 2 decent rollercoasters posted wait times of over 2 hours throughout the day - Obviously we missed out riding on those...

When I asked again about the express passes on the way out of the park the price had gone up to $80.00 - And I can only assume it would keep going up as the day wore on & park guests became more fruatrated with the the lines...

There is nowhere near enough rides in this park to satisfy the number of people who go here - the day I went was not peak season so I cannot imagine how much worse it would have been in school holiday time.

7,505232893,2017-07-24,MOBILE,1,"Universal Studios Singapore is the most disappointing theme park experience of my life - it is a money-making machine with very little soul and is a misery to go, at least on the day we went.

First off the positives; it is clean, the rides are good - that's where it ends.

I say the rides are good, in fact if you can get on them then they are excellent but therein lies the problem. We visited on a Friday and were prepared to do a bit of queuing but nothing prepared me for the way in which Universal have set up their Singapore experience (I have done Universal Studios in Japan and Florida and loved both of them). The park was by no means full on the day we went - that was obvious by the very empty queuing areas for each ride; at a rough guess I would say that for the most popular rides the queuing areas were about a quarter full for the whole day. Despite that the queue for all of the popular rides was an eye watering two hours for the vast majority of the day right up until the park closed.

The park opened at 10am on the day we went (we got in a at 10.30am) and the first ride we went on was The Mummy - queue time for that was an excellent 5 minutes. We came out of The Mummy and tried to go on one of the Battlestar Galactica roller coasters  - by this point queuing was at 70 minutes for that and rising fast. Having done one of the Battlestar Galactica roller coasters that was it, all the other popular rides had queuing times of 2 hours + each. At this point it was midday and we still hadn't done Transformers or Jurassic Park or the other Battlestar Galactica coaster; the heat was unbearable and the thought of spending the next 6 plus hours queuing for the three 'main' rides without anywhere to sit and no toilet facilities was not something we were prepared to contemplate - we therefore went on the other, not so popular, rides which all had queue times of about an hour and hoped that as the day wore on the queues might lessen - we were wrong. The curious thing is that none of the rides were packed; the extra queuing capacity lanes were all empty and on every single ride we were queueing in what would be considered the final stretch (in sight of the ride or in the building that houses the ride). As we went on a non-peak day (assuming it was because Universal didn't deign to put on any form of parade or firework show) the park closed at 7pm so we had to accept early on that we weren't going to get on every ride.

Two things were at work here - the first I'm surmising was that Universal were not running the park at full staff capacity and the rides weren't operating at a capacity to get people through. The second devil that was also playing its hand was the Universal Express Pass that allowed people who were willing to do so to pay an extra $90 SGD each (on top of the entry fee on the day we went that was what they were charging for it) to skip the queues for each ride or at least have a very minimal wait for the rides they wanted to go on. What Universal Singapore have to admit is that your base rate ticket for the park is simply an 'entry fee' and by no means guarantees you rides. On the day we went (not even a weekend or public holiday or school holiday) the price for the Express Pass alone was a third higher than the cost of getting in. It was clear to see that the park staff are under instruction to get the Express Pass customers on to rides at the expense of the people who don't have them - having observed some rides in detail whilst queueing I counted a ratio of 5 Express Pass customers boarding rides to every single regular ticket holder. When looking at Battlestar Galactica with a car capacity of about 14 people it's no wonder the queues in the pleb line were so long. 

My wife also observed Express Pass customers going on the Battlestar Galactica ride five or six times in succession while my daughter and I were waiting for our one, solitary 90 second go - my wife being cleverer than me gave up on the rides by late afternoon and had ample time to watch one chubby little fellow and his over-indulging Express Pass parents in great detail during her 70 minute wait outside the ride entrance/exit. That's not to criticise them for doing that, they paid their money for the Express Pass but hopefully, dear reader, it highlights what is rotten about this place.

You're probably reading this and thinking 'why didn't the cheapskate pay out for an express pass?' Fair question but I'd already paid about $210 SGD for the three of us to get in to the damned place - another $270 SGD for three Express Passes really wasn't high on my list of purchases. I'll also put it another way - we also went to the excellent Singapore Zoo where I didn't have to pay extra to see the lions or the polar bear and there wasn't a special line that gave a closer view of the animals to people who were willing to pay more - you pay your money and everybody is treated as equals, unless you're at Universal Singapore where the masses keep the park in business but the rich few are allowed to indulge just that little bit more. If people who weren't willing or able to pay for Express Pass boycotted the park then Universal would soon have to change their tune but I'm realistic to know that will never happen.

Let me also add in some more delights;

1. I like music but if you go to Universal Singapore then you really really have to love music being constantly played at full volume from speakers that are located everywhere in the park and from which there is no escape. Apart from the food outlets there is also very little in the way of seating areas to escape the chaos and take a break.

2. Food and drink costs are a little on the high side.

3. If you haven't queued enough during the day at Universal then you'll be delighted to know that when the park closes there is a further hour's queue to get back on the Sentosa 'Express' monorail.

4. To ensure they've squeezed every last dollar out of you there's a $4SGD entry fee into Sentosa.

5. There were a few exceptions but the Universal Singapore staff were the most miserable theme park staff I have ever encountered (to put that in context I've also been to Ocean Park in Hong Kong). 

6. The queues are littered with people who are on their own but after 20 minutes are then suddenly joined by the remaining twelve members of their family who all push in front of you. The queues are badly managed and not controlled by park staff apart from initial entry. If you have a particular passion for male, Indian tourists kicking the back of your legs and getting into areas of your personal space that even your loved ones wouldn't dare then you will adore the queues at Universal Singapore.

Luckily we were in Singapore for a couple of weeks and Universal was our one, bum day. 

You will read this review and will probably ignore it and may have a great time at Universal (no doubt with an Express Pass) but if you're time limited in Singapore then please consider a trip instead to the Singapore Zoo - I love theme parks and usually hate zoos but my day at Singapore Zoo was wonderful and the complete opposite of what I describe at Universal.

We also could have purchased at the reduced rate through our hotel, the Park Regis via their free “Handy” smart phone. As mentioned in several reviews it is a busy attraction to see and that it was. We arrived by public transport early, just after 10am on a weekday and there was a 10-minute queue to enter the park. We went to the first ride, and what we thought was a short queue was deceptive as it started to weave from a nice airconditioned area inside to outside. Then we were told the ride wait was 45 minutes. We noticed that there was another queue, the “Universal Express” and there was no queue. We ditched the queue and decided to check out what the cost was to buy the Universal Express ticket was and it was $100 SGD, which was the best purchase ever. This gave us the chance to do any ride multiple times but most importantly by-pass all the long 30-60 min queues, which most of the rides were for most of the day. Now that price may not work for a family but it really does help when it’s hot and humid. I would seriously and highly recommend buying the UE tickets. Also, it may be cheaper when buying it online with your entry ticket. There are about four rides where the UE tickets cannot be used. Also noticed there are height restrictions which they do enforce strictly. Our favourite ride was the “Transformer” 3D ride. I couldn’t fathom doing the Battle Star Gallactica rides, there are two – Human and Cyclon, one (which I can’t remember) you are sitting where your feet are dangling, and it’s a full-on ride. My partner did both and enjoyed them. There is the Water World show which was fun to watch and take a load off. Note that it is very loud due to bombs, gunfire going off. We sat high up in the stand however it was still loud. There is also a splash zone which is clearly indicated in that seating area. You will get wet doing the Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure and you will see that is the case when you see lots of people wearing ponchos. But if you don’t get a poncho you do get dry quick in the Singapore weather or there are drying pods. There are lockers available for use. Some are free for an hour and then cost $4 SGD per hour. Some rides you will be told and it is indicated that you cannot have bags so the lockers are handy. We were at the park for about five hours, so it is a full day out. Was a great nostalgic experience for an “old” kid (44 YO) like me. And I liked it far more than Disneyland Hong Kong, there are definitely more rides at Universal Studios.

So we were keen to revisit again on this trip.  It was exactly the same and the only thing different for us this time was that we paid an extra $80 each to have unlimited express access to most (but not all) rides which means you can skip the long queues and generally wait no more than 5 minutes to get on a ride.  This is well worth the cost when you realise that waiting periods to get on rides can be 30-90 minutes.  Not being a family of thrill seekers, we avoid the main roller coasters, but we love the 3D Transformer ride, the Revenge of the Mummy indoor roller coaster ride, and the Jurassic Park river ride (be prepared to get splashed or rather wet, but you'll dry quickly in the heat).  To be honest, if you like scary rides, there's not much apart from the twin roller coasters - a large portion of the Park is more suited to younger children - but there is something for everyone.  It is very clean and well maintained, though I thought the kids Madagascar river ride was looking a bit tired.  The Waterworld action stunt show is a lot of fun and something that the whole family will enjoy.
None of the food/dining options appealed to us so we got our hands stamped so that we could temporarily exit to have lunch elsewhere, then return.  There is a good range of dining options in the plaza outside Universal Studios - we had lunch at the Hard Rock Cafe which we really enjoyed, even though it is not a cheap dining option.  We arrived at the park at 10am when it opened and left at 4pm, I wanted to make sure we got our money's worth as it quite expensive when you are paying for 4 adult tickets plus unlimited express rides.

The most memorable ride are galactica and transformers. Galactica is roller coaster with 2 type of it, human and cyclone. For beginner i suggest the less extreme human, but if you want more try cyclone... i think. I didn't ride cyclone bec i'm scared, it turned you upside down. Also please place your stuff all of it includes coins in the locker and bring paper money in your pocket for paying lockers (please bring just enough for paying bec the machine not giving you changes). 

Second, my most favorite, transformers. Sure the queue are long, but satisfying. Loving the effect, the thrill, and animation! I even ride thrice, not bored!

The accelarator may be a starter for more wild ride, and shrek 4D can be a more calming ride in the middle. For jurassic rapid adventure for safety of your clothes and light belongis please use rain coat or place you stuff in the locker.

And to make matters worse while lining up for each of those rides in 30+ degree heat, there are rich express patrons (aka queue jumpers) getting straight to the front of the line, it seems like such an unfair system! Also on your website it says you close at 8pm....not true!  Rides finished at 6pm, not sure when your overpriced merchandise stores closed though.  I would never recommend Universal Studios, Singapore to anyone, we totally wasted money and a day of our short international holiday.

In short, after spending over $200 we spent the whole day there and only had four rides, and that is despite using the single rider option. It's a disgrace how they have allowed this place to become so overcrowded and expect patrons to wait over four hours for a ride, standing in line in the heat with people stinking with perspiration, yelling and pushing.

The day did not start off too well as our first ride, ""Transformers"" broke down and we waited for about 15 -20 mins before we were escorted out of the ride. While this was disappointing it was interesting seeing the interior of this attraction with everything at a standstill. It did take about 5 mins before staff alerted us to a problem and a while longer before staff came and collected us. We were told this occurred often as it is one of the more popular rides- and overheats! Our safety was never an issue and this was handled well and professionally by staff. We did try this ride three more times, with another breakdown occurring later in the day. 

The day did get better and Universal Studios is everything you would expect with many rides, shows, shops, and photo opportunities. The heat and humidity of Singapore made it difficult at times but there are many shaded and cool places to rest.  The rides varied from mild and relaxing (Madagascar) to terrifying and  exhilarating (Cylon).

We did buy the express ticket ($100.00 pp!!) which was very expensive but it meant not cuing for too long, or at all at times. This made the experience much more enjoyable and we could do rides as often as we liked. Some cues were over 90 mins waiting time and the express ticket cut this time down to 10-15 mins max for the more popular rides.
The food choices are many however the food itself was not great, and we walked around for a while to find the best we could. Some rides do not allow you to carry on and bags, hats, phones etc and lockers are provided- most are free for the first hour or so.

I have visited Universal in Los Angeles. If you have kids or have never visited Universal then it's worth a visit. If you've been to the real thing then it might disappoint because it doesn't compare to US Version and there are more authentic things to do in Singapore unless you have oodles of time.

Do plan ahead so that you can avoid missing out on the awesome rides. Wear comfortable shoes, take sun screen and go on the Jurassic Park rapids adventure near the end because you will get soaked depending on where you sit. Lockers are available to rent.

I am very conflicted about the whole notion of the Express ticket. I was told to definitely buy an Express ticket but by the time we knew which day we were going the on-line (considerably cheaper) allocation was sold out. At the park express tickets cost an extra $80 which seemed outrageous. But having this two tiered system definitely disadvantages the punters who buy an ordinary ticket. For example, the advertised wait time for the Jurassic park rapids adventure was 60mins. This was bad enough but because express ticket holders get priority this wait time blew out to over 2 hours!! A lot of reviews advise to get there early. We found that by evening the crowds had died down. I took the Transformer 4D ride at about 7pm and waited less than 15mins. Most of the other rides had a zero wait time by then. Food seemed very overpriced (e.g. $11 for a slice of pizza) so we ate outside but it was the most ordinary meal I had in my entire Singapore trip and a service tax was added just to make it even worse value.

4,501646102,2017-07-13,OTHER,1,"Unser zweiter Besuch nach Februar 2012, auf Wunsch meines mittlerweile 12jährigen Sohnes. Es war am ersten Freitag im Juli. Freitag, weil ich hier mehrfach gelesen habe, dass man das Wochenende wegen der Menschenmassen meiden sollte. Allerdings kann ich mir schwer vorstellen, dass am Wochenende noch mehr los ist als an diesem Freitag. Parköffnung um 10 Uhr, wir kamen leider erst um ca. 10.30 Uhr zum Park. Regulärer Eintrittspreis 76 SGD (ca. 50 EUR) pro Erwachsenen und 56 SGD für ein Kind bis 12 Jahre, also wahrlich kein Schnäppchen. Ein Saisonticket kostet nicht viel mehr, das heißt, die Urlauber sponsern die Einheimischen. Angeboten werden noch zwei Arten von Expresstickets; mit einem davon kann man an den Top-Attraktionen jeweils 1x an der Warteschlange vorbei (kostet meiner Erinnerung nach 60 SGD pro Person), und mit der zweiten Art kann man unlimitiert an den Warteschlangen vorbei (natürlich noch teurer, Preis weiß ich nicht mehr). Wir haben beschlossen, uns nicht weiter abzocken zu lassen und haben keine Expresstickets gekauft – im Nachhinein betrachtet wohl ein Fehler.

Unser erster Weg war zum Favorit meines Sohnes, nämlich Transformers Ride. Als wir uns angestellt haben war die Wartezeit nicht angeschrieben, und man sieht beim Anstellen nicht, wie lange die Schlange ist, man wird nämlich von Raum zu Raum geschleust. Nach über 15 min Warten kam dann die Durchsage, dass die Wartezeit für Neuankömmlinge 2 Stunden beträgt. Sch…, was tun? Wir entschieden uns leider dafür, in der Schlange zu bleiben, um nicht die 15 min Anstellzeit zu verlieren, und hofften darauf, dass die 2 Stunden eine Schätzung mit Sicherheitspolster sind. Wir sollten uns täuschen, nach 2 Stunden und 35 Minuten (!!!) waren wir endlich dran. Und nun weiß ich auch, weshalb es so lange dauert: Eingestiegen wird immer gleichzeitig in 2 Wagen mit je 12 Personen. Und einer der Wagen wird nur mit Expressticketinhabern gefüllt. Beim zweiten Mal haben wir es in der Einzelfahrerschlange versucht. Die Dame beim Eingang meinte „20-30 min Wartezeit“, es sind dann auch wieder 45 min geworden. 

Universal Studios kann offenbar den Hals nicht voll genug kriegen. Eine Familie mit 2 Erwachsenen und einem Kind zahlt für einen Tag fast 150 EUR Eintritt und wird als Kunde zweiter Klasse behandelt. Nur wenn diese Familie bereit ist, fast 300 EUR Eintritt für den Tag auf den Tisch zu legen, kann sie entsprechend häufiger fahren.

Es muss jedoch gesagt werden, dass es viele Attraktionen mit geringen Wartezeiten von wenigen Minuten gibt. Bei weiteren Top-Attraktionen wie zB den Achterbahnen steht man jedoch überall länger als eine Stunde. Viele Attraktionen sind wirklich gut, aber bei diesen Wartezeiten wird einem der Besuch vermiest.",Unverschämte Abzocke,2017-07-01,FAMILY,MarkVien,"Vienna, Austria",Vienna,Austria,-1

It was a weekday and the weather forecast predicted rain in the morning, which resulted in thinner crowds. The waiting time for rides ranged from 5 to 90 minutes. There are electronic boards at various locations showing waiting times for rides as well as show times. Since the compound is not big, it is easy to hop around the various zones to catch the rides with shorter queues. The queues became shorter in the evening. I was at USS from 1pm to 7.30pm, and I caught all the rides except 3 kiddy rides which I skipped.

There are several locker rooms for rides that do not allow you to bring carry-on bags. The locker rooms are chargeable. If you just want to put aside your bag for a short while, I recommend using the locker rooms in Sci-Fi City or Ancient Egypt, because the first 45 minutes are free.

Since we got just a regular ticket, we spent most of our time waiting in queues. Queues can take up to 2 hours for popular rides such as the Battlestar Galactica roller coasters and Transformers 3D. Waiting and standing in the queue was torture for me (both mentally and physically), I hated every moment and almost gave up several times. My partner on the other hand, was really patient and trying to be positive about the queue. There was several times in the queues where we discussed about getting the Express Ticket but because it was peak season, the Express Ticket costs $70 for 1 and that's almost the same price as an entry ticket. (Note that the prices for Express Ticket is dynamic, it increases as demand increases.) We always ended up deciding that we couldn't afford it as we wanted to stick to our budget :'(

The sun was also very unforgiving, it's really really hot! The weather can really beat you down and make you fatigued, so be sure to drink lots of fluids (there are many free drinking taps and slightly pricey F&B carts/restaurants around the park) and perhaps bring a hat, an umbrella or a mini fan.

I must say that all the rides we managed to take were really good though! Especially the Transformers 3D ride, which is highly popular, even for people who can't or don't want to ride on roller coasters. Another awesome part is that everything in the park was designed really really beautifully! I'm blown away by all the details and only wished that I had more time and energy to appreciate them all.

3,500319378,2017-07-10,MOBILE,1,"I bought an express pass for this attraction as the people at the ticket office said the park was busy and I wanted to do most of the rides that day. 

I was surprised that some of the express lines were longer than the standard lines!! I found this part of the experience terrible as I paid more to try and go through faster. Either way I had to now stand in the long lines in the heat and sweat a lot. The line for the transformers ride was 2hrs and 30mins which was unacceptable and I was not willing to wait that long for one go. We could not go on many of the rides as the wait times were unreasonable and it was boiling. 

One of the employees working at the park for the cyclone ride did not even understand english yet she works at a tourist attraction which was shocking and disappointing for Universal studios to employ such people. I had to ask her one question in 5 different ways in english and eventually use sign language for her to understand in which case she finally understood. Very disappointing.. 

The food outlets are also quite pricey inside although you can get some unique kind of sweets inside such as the new 'ice-smoke-popcorn.' There are also many curio shops inside which I also found quite pricey but that I guess is up to individual buyers although I wouldn't recommend buying from here. Maybe a magnet or souvenir is okay to get, nothing more. 

Overall the wait times in the heat were bad and I really was soaked in my own sweat just waiting in the long lines as some of the lines had no air conditioning. They need to install air conditioning in all the waiting areas especially if people are spending so much time waiting. The park is making people suffer in the heat and everyone else in the line was soaked in their own sweat and they were sticky. Air-conditioning is a massive improvement much needed for the waiting areas. 

Positives: Besides the factors mentioned, the park design was good and the layout was good. Many food places and toilets around the park. I would recommend an entire day from the open to close of the park times to get your full moneys worth.

Cueing is just dreadful!  I don't mind cueing as long as it is organised, this one wasn't. Remember the humid weather, add cueing and some unruly visitors.... one might lose it! 

The staffs were incredibly professional, helpful and looked like they are enjoying their job. There are many restaurants to choose from.

The rides are pretty much the same not surprising as they are under Universal banner.

As for some visitors... I think it's rude to just leave 10 mins after the show has started. Ok not everyone grew up watching Sesame Street but for many ( like myself) Sesame Street is an ikon and try not to ruin it for the rest of us by intentionally breaking the rules of the house like video recording, taking pictures, texting friends and watching Facebook updates! That is rude!!!

Recommendation: 
1. buy tickets online! You don't want to cue straight away even before entering the park. They give discounts in the restaurants inside the park except Starbucks and little trolley vendors. I know you still have to line by the cues are like less than 10 people compared to hundreds onsite ticket cues. You just have to present your mobile email of proof of ticket purchase.

2. The Jurassic park water ride, you will get wet including your footwear. If you're wearing flip flops well done, if not better get a pair or walk barefoot so they won't get wet. The drying machine outside will help but not enough to dry your shoes.

3. Humid is such a problem so do hydrate yourself all the time and try to put sun cream on or whatever to protect yourself from heat.

4. There are lockers just like other theme parks at a minimal charge.

0,499516950,2017-07-07,OTHER,4,"Think of it as Universal Studios Hollywood with the back lot removed and all of the attractions condensed into a smaller area. That's not a bad thing really, I mean how many times do you do the back lot tram tour anyway, and with everything in a smaller area you're not hiking all over the place to get from one attraction to the next.

There is still much to do here and you can easily spend most of the day here. There was no King Kong ride here and the Mummy ride is set up differently, there are other differences as well but nothing that distracted from the fun. 

The one negative was the food, it may have been because of the place I stopped to eat but it left a bad taste in my mouth both literately and figuratively. I stopped at a place called Fossil Fuel over in the Jurassic Park area, they sell several different hot dogs at $8.80 SGD each, I chose the Bacon Cheese Dog and an order of fries for $4.00 SGD.

When my order was ready it didn't look very good, the hot dog didn't look cooked and the cheese wasn't melted, the fries looked okay. The hot dog tasted as bad as it looked and the fries were just okay. So do yourself a favor and don't eat at Fossil Fuel. There is another place close by called Discovery Food Court, it looked promising but I didn't try it. If you want to play it safe get your hand stamped and exit the park. There are several places to eat just outside or hop on the Sentosa Express to the VivoCity mall, there you will find many choices in all price categories.

The easiest way to get to Sentosa Island is to take the MRT  North-East line to the Harbourfront Station, this will drop you off right at VivoCity, go to level 3, there you can purchase tickets for all of the attractions on Sentosa Island including Universal Studios and the Sentosa Express.",Great way to spend the day,2016-08-01,COUPLES,Mike D,"Hua Hin, Thailand",Hua Hin,Thailand,-1

It's overcrowded esp on weekends and holidays but still good place to go. Some tips
1. It's ok even if you reach a bit late . The whole world is there early so you won't gain much.
2. Plan and do the shows first as they happen at fixed timings 
3. Never stand in a Q which says 45min-1hr waiting . All of these become available after 6pm easily so do the rides with short wait time first 
4 Fast pass of 50$ is very helpful if you want to do all rides. But most of the rides are roller coasters so if you don't like doing them don't take a fast pass 
5 you can take your own food inside
6 food options inside are limited esp for vegetarians so pack something and go
7 . Fireworks are decent but nothing great . The background is just ok too so you won't miss much even if you miss it 
8 do online booking as tickets are cheaper

Shopping is a expensive but it is so in all theme parks 

How to reach : take a MRT to harbor front and then one to sentosa. Or take a direct taxi it takes about 10$ from city. If you are a group of 3-5 take a taxi as it's easier .

The attractions are good but I feel that with the exception of Jurassic Park, the rides here are pretty short... Queuing an hour for a short ride is kind of a bummer. They are great rides, don't get me wrong, but I think a new and longer ride is due, to compete with up and coming theme parks (eg 20th Century Fox in Genting Highlands).

The food is decently priced especially when you purchase a season pass (very worth) and I recommend checking out ZT grill because it comes with a 20% discount with the season pass. 

I feel that one thing that was a let down though was the staff. They weren't quite as friendly as before on the day that I went, on certain rides only.

Tips: 
If you are a tourist from overseas, try to pick off peak days like weekdays. During the July to August period, the schools are on here, hence weekdays might be less crowded with locals (although, its the peak of the summer holidays so it might be more crowded with tourists). Weekends are good if you want to watch the fireworks and the parade, but expect long queues.

Enter the park early and leave at closing to make the most of your day. In fact, you can leave when the park is crowded in the afternoons (esp before lunch), and come back at around 3 pm when tourists start to leave (remember to get a stamp to reenter). Head straight for Cylon and Human roller coasters for and then transformers. These rides have the longest queues just 0.5 to 1 hour after the park opens. Jurassic Park opens at 11am so head there next after the transformers. The Mummy typically has shorter queues and Puss in Boots is usually alright as well.

If you are happy to wait 1 hour minimum for the basic rides then knock yourself out. But anything good was anywhere from 60-  120 minutes wait, and this seems to be normal. You join queues that says 60 minutes, and the line is half empty and it still takes 80 minutes. So the place is designed to pack in as many people as possible knowing that people will queue for 2 hours. Not what I would consider fun at all, and I regard the design as disrespect to paying customers. For $400 for a family of 4, we went on 4 rides all day. Seriously. If you are planning on going I suggest forking out the extra $$ for the express lane to try and skip queues (again another joke at design and money gauging). Otherwise, skip it and do something else there is plenty of other things to do on the island.","Incredibly disappointing, totally disrespectful",2017-06-01,NONE,ljajc,,,,1

17,496377852,2017-06-26,OTHER,5,"My husband and I were at USS yesterday 26 June 2017.After a lot of thinking, we finally decided to get the express passes (one time use on each ride), got it online in advance along with the day pass. I would say we made the best decision, as this reduced waiting time to 5mins max for Transformers, Galactica, Revenge of the mummies and even Shrek 4D. I truly felt so bad passing by the queue next to us (those without the express pass) with ease . We were told their waiting time for a ride like Jurassic rapids was 1hour20min!! and ours was just 30secs. I can only imagine how much longer waits were for them for Galactica and Transformers. So i can only recommend taking the Express pass. Further, i think the day was much more enjoyable (inspite of the heat and humidity) and we made it through to the end of the day only cuz we weren't exhausted standing in queues. This does add to the overall experience IMO.

Okay now for the rides. Gallactica was great, super crazy I'd say. Transformers was an experience f a lifetime. We were seated in the front of the carriage and it was thrilling. Awesome experience. Jurassic rapids was nice to cool off, ponchos/raincoat were available, we just got ours from 7/11 near our hotel before heading out to USS. But i must mention that you don't get drenched as such for need of a poncho-raincoat. It just a little water here and there. And there are drying 'cubicles' in the dry zone outside the Jurassic ride to dry off urself in seconds. The Water World Shows were 3 times a day. we went for the 5pm one. The stunts and display of fire and water stunts were out of this world. The stuntmen also play around with kids and adults with water and get the crowd wet. Note they only get you wet if u choose to sit in the SPLASH(indicated on the seat so u can choose)zone. But its a lot of fun, they were all so interactive with the crowd and made it a fun experience. The Dance for the beans by Puss in boots in Far far away zone was great for kids. Shrek 4D is a must-try, don't be fooled that its for kids only. There were more adults than kids, so that says a lot. The 4D motion (seats moved, water sprinkle etc) added to the whole experience. 

About facilities, Washrooms were plenty and clean. People on TA have spoken about food being expensive, but we did find a few places that were not heavily priced. In the Jurassic zone there was a local cuisine right at the entrance, looked like a food court and prices were normal as outside (a meal for 2 was $40 including drinks). Lockers at Sci-Fi near Gallactica (Human-red and Cylon-blue) were free from 105 mins to 120 mins. They were easy to use, so we used them in between the coaster rides like Transformers, Gallactica, Jurassic where you have to put ur stuff in lockers. Revenge of the mummies lockers are free for the first 40mins. Jurassic lockers were for a fee beginning at $4 so we put out bags in the SCIFI lockers. Its not a long walk between the Sci Fi, Egypt zone and Jurassic, just about over a minute walk. So keeping bags in the sci-fi free lockers and coming back to get them is not tiresome at all. The whole USS area is walkable. We honestly did 3 rounds of it during the entire day.

The Hollywoods Lake Spectacular Fireworks at the end of the day at 8:30pm were worthy the wait. Probably good to get a seated space at the stairs near the Lake near Mel's drive-in restaurant, 20 mins ahead of the show.

The characters come out for the parade that starts at Water World (near Lost World) and passes by Sci-fi, egypt and ends at New York zones. So for the parade do not wait in Madagascar. far far away or hollywodd, the parade does not go there. Check for timings when the characters also come out in their respective zones for free pictures to be taken with your own camera

USS is wheelchair accessible, and plenty of facilities for kids and pram rentals etc.

The only bit I need to highlight is the FREE photo redemption voucher we got when we purchased our tickets online. This gives you a free photo in the dark room(near the entrance next to Starbucks in Hollywood zone). To get a free print of your photo, you need to first get yourself clicked at the photo booths in the zones, and finally on your way out of USS you visit the dark room and get a free print. Like there was one photo booth near transformers but nooone told us that these photos are for free with the voucher. So we missed the chance to get a free photo taken with Optimus prime robot. So check this out where you see the ladies with cameras in all zones.

I have enclosed the show timings, if it helps decide an itinerary. Its available at the entrance of USS. best to plan your days ahead with the rides and show timings, so you don't miss out. I must point out that the express pass helped us here, as we were not stuck in queues for the rides and hence did not miss any of the shows we wanted to see.

The waterworld show is fantastic. Lots of efforts seems to have gone in enacting those stunts live. Really commendable.
The general feel of walking through the USS streets after all the shows/rides have shut down, late in the evening is quite nice. It is actually like walking on the streets of a Disney movie.
The fireworks on Saturday 8.30 pm is spectacular.

Many fun and challenging attractions in 7 themed zones in USS will give you a great time in Sentosa. Go earlier will give you a better chance to ride in popular rides (Transformers, Mummy, Jurassic Park) without having to wait in long queues. You must go for the Transformers: The Ultimate 3D Battle and Battlestar Galactica (Roller Coaster). Weekdays are better to go. If you go early (at least by 9.30 AM) and manage time, you will finish above mentioned rides before 11.00 AM which I could do. Then the rest you can enjoy freely. Others are Far Far Away zone where you can also experience a 4-D movie and Madagascar ride. USS Express passes are not really necessary. 1-day pass is sufficient and can get you to all the main features of the theme park.

Lockers are available to keep your bags while you ride on the rides. You cannot take anything with you on roller coasters. Some lockers are free for 45 minutes and some are not free (Jurassic Park Lockers will charge 4 SGD).

We were there from opening to closing. We found that the queues were shorter early and later in the day. A massive wait for Jurassic ride (probably because of everyone wanting to cool off!), but the express pass definitely helped there.

Once you get over that then there is a great park to be enjoyed. The new transformers ride is amazing and the Shrek show is really good. A lot of roller coasters compared to the states and is more like an islands of adventures and the studios park.

The water world show was really good and is a must see.

In fact, we paid with MasterCard and got 10% off ticket prices and got a voucher to collect a free photo taken within the park (with characters or on a ride). 

Most people look on trip advisor to see if they should go, when they should go and what ticket to buy - I'll try to answer this.

Yes you should go if you're in Singapore and fancy some rides for the day however it is very small compared to Universal Florida and even Thorpe Park in the U.K. 

We went on a Thursday and it was busy so it doesn't matter what day of the week you go.

Ticket - the fast track is worth it if you want to get on all the rides in one day. Queue times (normal queue) were from 30mins to 120 mins. (Shorter from 5-7pm). Although the fast track ticket was expensive, we went on every ride and didn't queue and we still spent 6 hours here.

Don't want to buy fast track? The rides that are worth queuing for (if you like big rides with a thrill) are: Cylon (roller coaster) and Transformers 4D ride. These are the only two that I came off thinking they were really good. Next rides kinda worth queuing for would be The Mummy, Water world (stunt show), Human (roller coaster) and Shrek 4D. All other rides were either for children or just weren't that good. If you don't want to pay for express ticket, take my advice on rides and if you have time left you can try the others. We took the rides for what they were but the theme park appears to be for children or those who don't like big rides.

Another disappointment (especially if you have children) was that we didn't see any 'characters' walking around in each section even though the map advertised that they would be around all day (not sure where they were). Finally, each 'land' had a good theme but it needs to be improved e.g the 'lost world' had the 'Jurrasic park' gate but then no dinosaurs in the land, just trees, and the rides lacked dinosaurs. I think the rides felt a bit half heartedly done with the 'theme' compared to Florida Orlando and even Disneyland Paris.",Average in comparison to other theme parks,2017-06-01,COUPLES,Rachel L,"Haywards Heath, United Kingdom",Haywards Heath,United Kingdom,1

I was there with my girlfriend and we enjoyed the show and attraction they had. I would say that get there early to enjoy the opening of the Studio and get to the top most popular roller coasters before the line start to build up. We arrived at the Studio at around 09:37 and there were already large crowds waiting in line. The first who arrive at the park will get the chance to ""open"" the gate for everyone else with the host at the main gate so that's something special.
Since we arrived somewhat early, we stored our bag at one of few automatic lockers spread out around the park. It cost 15 SDG for a whole day and 14 SDG for 4 hours.
I stored by bag due to that two of the main roller coasters won't allow you to bring bag and most lose items, I guess it's safer for you to place your belongings inside a locker than leave it by the side of the roller coaster loading area where everyone can access your belongings.
Bring sunscreen to protect yourself and water bottle which you can fill up at water dispensers around the park.
During peak times the rides can take up to 120 minutes to queue up (Transformers: The Ride). Suggest you head to that one first, it is located in SciFi city.

Be there at 10am sharp when the gate opens, only then you can able to cover the entire park.
If u r going on weekends or during peak season time or with young children don't mind getting a express ticket. It will save you really alots and lots of time and energy. I managed to cover the entire park at ease with my wife and 2 yr old kid (as few rides we have to go separately since the baby is not allowed). It's a must infact, the wait time for Highlighted rides are atleast 60min and for other it varies from 15 to 30. (Peak season)
Plan your rides with the help of the map. So that you no need to wander and waste time.
Each movie theme has 4 attractions.

Hollywood is the first thing you see when you enter the park. Don't waste time in clicking pictures here as you will have enough time at the end.

Start with MADAGASCAR - Boat ride a must if you are with children. Adults too enjoy. Party go round again for children.

FAR FAR AWAY - Shrek 4D Adventure is 15 min movie screening. Worth a watch.
Magic potion spin - For kids
Enchanted airways for all

THE LOST WORLD - Jurassic Park rapids adventure is a must.
Canopy flyer you can give a try if there's less crowd as express doesn't apply for this one.
Dino sourin - For kids
Amber rock climbing - can be skipped
Water world - Try to see the 1am show so that you no need to walk all the way back here to see the 4pm one.

ANCIENT EGYPT - REVENGE OF THE MUMMY is a must. I repeat it's a must. People with certain conditions are not allowed. As this ride is a roller coaster based and scary too. I would say this is the best in USS.
Treasure Hunter - Kids will love it.

SCI FI CITY - 2 extreme roller coasters narrowly avoid collisions. Go for it if you can really able to withstand.
Accelerator - MUST MUST. Don't miss it. Again one the best in USS.

LIGHTS CAMERA ACTION - A studio demonstration. Worth a watch.

Few more rides for kids and don't forget to visit the candy factory near the end of the park.

P.S. All rides have souvenir shops and you will be forced to exit only by that way like every other place. So don't waste your time on them.
Stroller service available at the gates.
People carrying young children don't forget to inform the people at the counter to tag your kids by a unique coded band. Even if your kids are lost you can trace their exact location inside the park by their GPS system once informed.

There are lockers when you first go in which were useful to store our stuff rather than lug it around all day. The food was usual theme park stuff but wasn't too bad I don't think it was overpriced compared to anywhere else in Singapore you can go out of the park and come back in to go for lunch out the front where there are restaurants. The most annoying thing about this place is the que jumping which drove us crazy, the Indian way of queuing is to get one person to que at each ride then call your relatives down when your near the front, often this could be 10 more people !!! My wife even caught one guy trying to go through the exit to miss the que all together nearly bowling over my 5 year old in the process. In the end when we realised how blatant this was we simply refused to let them pass - it was really annoying that we had to do what the theme park staff should be doing.

—RWS8 charges a dollar or 2. It drops you to a place (RWS) from which you can access places like Adventure Cove, the S.E.A Aquarium and Universal Studios.

—From there you can go to other places of Sentosa (such as the Sentosa Merlion and Luge ride) using bus 1 and 2.

—Lockers: At most rides there are lockers which can be accessed before the ride which are free for about 45 minutes. 

—Must Do: Transformers the Ultimate 3D Battle, Battle star Galactica Human and Cyclone, Revenge of the Mummy, Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure, Amber Rock climb (you will need a photo ID), Water World (Show), Enchanted Airways and the Rockafellas (Show). We didn’t do any character meet and greet. We didn’t do Accelerator, Canopy flyer and Puss in Boots’ Giant Journey which seemed pretty good (Worth a try).
Note: All the rides mentioned here are pretty fast especially revenge of the Mummy. 

—Other Rides: We didn’t do any other shows and rides except Lights, Camera, Action! Shrek 4D Adventure and Madagascar: A crate adventure which were fine.

—Restrooms and water: There are restrooms at regular intervals with water fountains.

—Express Pass: Most of the rides at Universal Studios have very long waiting lines. So if you love rides you may as well buy one. At first we were saying we should just buy one but at the end of the day we fared pretty well even though we had to wait for 30 to 45 minutes at some rides. So in the end it is up to you. But if you really love rides you should just buy it.

Eating: There are a few good places to eat. But we just took cheesy fries and onion rings from Mel’s Dinettes.

—Packaged foods are allowed but not homemade food. You will be told not to eat homemade food inside.

 —If you can take enough food to satisfy you till the eve you can have a wonderful dinner at any of the places around the main circle of RWS. It has many places like McDonalds, Starbucks, Gong Cha, Chilies, Hard Rock Café, etc.",A day of Fun,2017-05-01,FAMILY,Nihar,"Mumbai, India",Mumbai,India,1

The boat ride at Madagascar was ok, a bit reminiscent of the Winnie the Pooh boat ride in HK Disney. The wait for Shrek 4D is terrifying, and the introductory presentation scares you more than the movie. We took the stationary seats as the compere scared us so much but the actual show was quite pleasant. The Waterworld show at the Lost World was frankly not my idea of fun. It seemed like a live action performance from a Hollywood movie. With all that gunfire, despite being near water, you end up feeling very stuffy even on the soak or splash zones. Most of the other indoor and street shows were quite underwhelming. We managed to see Donkey Live, a live animated show, pretty funny and different. But expected a real donkey actually! Also managed to meet the minions and some other characters floating around at the entrance. The Chocolate World, so widely advertised, is a let down. Just an indoor area with fake choc cookies hanging from lighted trees. You need to buy the marshmallows if you need to dip them in the choc fountains. 
The worst part about USS is that they do not allow outside food and drink but then food inside is exorbitantly priced. Even outside, at candylicious in Sentosa, a small cup of gelato costs $6! It's much better to wait and eat at Vivo City.

We arrived at approximately 2 pm and stayed until 7 pm. It was crowded but not too crowded. The atmosphere was great and we were mostly happy with the rides. The cylon/human ride was great. The food isn't too pricey. 
Negative: This sort of ruined the day for us, but we had to wait in line for two hours for the Transformers ride. There wasn't a sign on the outside that stated estimated waiting time and we would never have gone in if we had known. Once you get through the queue on the outside, there are many small rooms on the inside where the line continues, in our case for two hours total. Honestly, it became quite claustrophobic as you never know when you're at the front of the line and get disseapointed after every corner.

One way to beat the Q is to go as single rider - you may not do the ride as a family or group, but you will certainly save time. We were in the Q for 80 minutes to do our first ride - Transformers. The single person who joined us was in the Q for just 10 minutes. The only plus point is Q management is good and you are in AC environment while in Q. The Transformers ride was good with excellent 3D effects. Don't miss it.

Food is quite expensive with a burger meal costing sgd 15. It makes sense to go outside and have food in the resorts - plenty of options - hard rock cafe, macD, pizza, bread talk, toast box etc. I mean if you have to pay through your nose, you may as well go to a quality restaurant.

For quite a few rides, you have to rent a locker. They charge you SGD 4 per hour as locker rent. Then there is a drying pod where it is SGD 5 per person! So be prepared to shell out over and above the entry ticket.

We did Revenge of the Mummy ride with about 15 minutes wait time. The ride was good and be prepared for surprises.

The Jurassic park ride will wet your shoes. Advisable to keep your belongings in a locker for this one. The wait time was 30 minutes.

In the second half of the day, we found wait times reducing. There is a board in front of each ride giving the wait time and it was between 5 to 30 minutes.

The water world stunt show was so-so. The one we had seen in Bangkok was far better.

The Shrek 4D movie was quite good. The canopy flyer ride was good - try to sit in the front 2 seats for better views. The Madagascar crate adventure is also worth going. And don't miss the Madagascar Boogie show and photo opp with characters.

Whenever you happen to go, do not forget to spend a little more and get the Express Entry Pass for your family else you will keep waiting in lines and waste the purpose of your visit. We had taken the pass for single entry for each activity which gave us ample time to enjoy the rides & shows we wanted.

As you enter, you pick up your entry tickets, clear the security checks; please do not carry any food items (except for young kids), and walk on the street. Along the streets, right at the entry, you will find an outlet from where you can buy your Express Entry Pass. The cost of the pass will depend on the demand of the pass; more the demand, higher the price. The studio city is beautifully conceptualised, planned, created and constructed. Right from the streets, shops / outlets to the shops on wheels, to anything in there.

We as a family enjoyed the roller coaster, specially the one which took us on a spin, I think it was the Cylone. This was a first for us, Adrenalin was pumping as we started our journey, then came the 360 degree spins, WoW, Amazing, Awesome, have no words to explain.

The shows that are performed are awesome.

The others too were good but these were really exciting which we enjoyed.

The place caters to various cuisines which can satisfy the taste buds of people from across the globe. One needs to be sure to consume enough water else it may dehydrate you.

2) Visit the Transformers (3D and roller coaster) and Mummy and. They are the most crowded ones for obvious reasons and doing the ride early will let you go back for seconds or thirds.

3) Do not spend you time for the shows early in the morning, they shows are repeated 3-4 times in the day, so save them for the evening, when it is less sunny.

4) Carry your own water bottle, it is very expensive inside.

5) Make use of free lockers. The average wait time is displayed before each ride.

6) Almost all rides have ""single rider"" line. Make use of this, trust me it will save you tonnes of time. I did the Jurassic rapid without a single mins wait, whereas the wait time displayed outside was over an hour.

7) No matter what you do, you will get drenched in the Jurassic rapid, so that 5$ poncho is really a waste. Also, with the humidity, it did not take more than 10 mins for my clothes to dry.

8) There are photo ops at specific time with major characters - Minions | Transformer | Shrek etc, check the timing before entering the park.

9) The longest lines are for transformers roller coaster. If it gets too crowded and if money is not a problem, it may be worthwhile in investing in the express pass.

Madagascar Boogie is a treat, especially for the fans as there's photo op after enjoying the show. Shrek 4D is enjoyed mostly by kids. 

We went on a Monday, and almost every Singaporean we spoke with said it was a wise move on our part. They may be right because we enjoyed being the 2nd in line for the Transformers the Ride (this is a MUST for everyone, though I'm a die-hard Jurassic Park rapids fan -- this now tops my list of rides). We went past through several of those zig-zag queue areas, and I can't imagine being there on a ""peak day"".

The character meet and greet and photo ops are, of course, also a highlight of the trip. The kid and grown-ups alike enjoyed the Minion store and meet & greet (Bello! Banana!)

We missed the Hollywood Dreams Parade, though, having gone on a weekday. I guess that's the trade-off for not queuing for hours on a ride.

4,488345592,2017-05-27,MOBILE,4,"First, the bad things:
- Obnoxious tourists from certain countries were a handful, but ubiquitous, they are most annoying when queuing for rides, with people cutting queues because their friends or families are already ahead without even saying the slightest apologetic words. But if you are one of them, you will feel right at home.
- Sheltered areas are limited, so if it rains (and in Singapore it rains hardest at the most unexpected time), you will most likely get wet, especially if you are unwilling to give up your queue and just so happen you are at the outdoor part of the queue. But worry not, because the gift shops sell everything you will need to dry up afterwards, including towels!

And the goods:
- The layout of the theme park is fantastic! It's a wonder how much they can squeeze within such a small area. You don't need to walk a whole lot to complete the whole park.
- Attraction staffs are not the friendliest (the friendlier ones get to work at the gift shops), but they work very efficiently, and most importantly know how to handle unruly obnoxious tourists (read above).

The best part:
- Battlestar Galactica Roller Coaster! Particularly if you are a roller coaster lover, you've got to go for this one! These steel duelling Roller Coasters are only available in Universal Studios Singapore. Made by Vekoma, a veteran in Roller Coaster industry, the Human coaster is a launched sit-down no-inversion Roller Coaster with top speed of 56mph (90 km/h), while Cylon coaster is an inverted Roller Coaster with 5 inversions. My personal favourite is the Human coaster, and if you only have time for one, my personal recommendation is to go for the Human coaster.

Tips:
- You can avoid the crowds by taking alternative routes to go around the park, these routes are marked with disabled sign, and most probably designed to accomodate people with wheel chair.
- When taking the extreme rides such as Battlestar Galactica or Revenge of the Mummy, leave everything behind to someone who doesn't have the stomach to take the ride, or put them in the free fingerprint activated locker. They don't let you bring anything even in your pocket, probably for a good reason.
- Take the popular rides in the afternoon, where (surprisingly) there are less people in the queue (apart from the obnoxious tourists, they seem to be around no matter when). As an example, the Battlestar Galactica rides waiting time drop to 30 minutes at 3PM on a clear-skyed Saturday. Of course, if you have the money to spare, get the Universal Express, which will give you much faster access to popular rides (and some unfriendly jealous stares from people queueing in the normal lane).",Must.

0,488307136,2017-05-27,MOBILE,4,"As you'd expect from a theme park, universal studios offers you exciting rides and nostalgic experiences from our favorite movies such as Shrek, Transformers, The Mummy, Sesame Street and a lot more. 
You can't bring food inside the park, so you have to prepare to shell out for the expensive food from the restos inside the park.
Expect long queues from their well loved rides such as The Mummy, Transformers and their 2 roller coasters, especially on weekends and holidays. If pressed for time, I suggest you avail of their express pass. Although more expensive, it will save you a lot of queue time, as the express pass holders have a priority lane for each ride.

Overall I have to say I was really impressed with the park! It is no where near the size of the US parks; the zones are very small and you can discover all of the themed areas in one day. I did all but 2 attractions, despite the rain and the fact none of the outside rides were open till about midday I still managed to do the whole park. 

A couple of things really impressed me: the variety of food available. Unlike other theme parks that theme restaurants but only sell a limited range, nearly every restaurant here sells something different so it's worth walking around! Another thing was the amount of queuing done inside - away from both the heat and the rain! Made for a much more pleasurable experience. The queue times during my visited ranged from a couple of minutes but even during the dry afternoon when the coasters reopened nothing was longer than 30mins! 

Most rides have single rider queues too. Overall I was impressed by the length of the rides, some of the kid friendly rides were much longer than I have experienced in other parks. Shows are also a must!!!

You need to use lockers for most of the rollercoasters - you can't join the queue with your belongings. I was apprehensive at using this service but turned out to be extremely easy and efficient. 

Two things really annoyed me: 1) The time is took to load rides was poor - this part of the operation isn't slick at all. It was taking close to 5 mins to load the Battlestar Galactica cars (on both tracks). This needs to be quicker during peak season. 2) The amount of people that were pushing their way to the front of the queue to join their family! Absolutely nothing was being done to stop this. In some cases 3 people would be joined by 8-10 more. Incredibly frustrating. Something must be done to stop this.

0,487319578,2017-05-24,OTHER,5,"Amazing experience over the weekend. There was lot of crowd. However we could still manage to cover the major rides. The park is divided into various sections like Jurassic Park, Transformers, Far Far Away, Puss in Boots etc. As you enter the attraction you happen to see the way the entire place has been made in various themes. There is a system of buying express tickets it means that in addition to the tickets which you have already bought if there is a lot of rush for a particular ride and one needs to quickly get a chance to access the ride then the ticket proves useful. However the rate of the ticket changes as the day passes by.It is usually cheap in the morning. Some of the rides that I liked were the roller coaster in ""Ancient Egypt"" and ""The Transformers"" experience.

8,487254548,2017-05-24,OTHER,2,"Had been to this park twice for the past few years but never was I shocked this much from the horrible experience I had from my last trip. Five of us visited the park two days consecutively (22 and 23 May 17) first day without Express Pass, 2nd day with unlimited Express Passes (except to the one 8-year-old in our group)
 
1- Long queue is very understandable from a park with a world-class name such as this and I expected no less queue from this particular park. But the digital queue time indicators were not working properly, saying 10-minute wait time when in fact it is 50 minutes and saying 60 minutes when it is just 20 minutes...is just not acceptable! All major rides (Transformer, Battlestar, Jurassic, etc. had this problems on our last visits) Our rendez vous with friends was a mess! We had no reliable way to plan and synchronize our time in the park. Our plans were all scrambled and for this, we managed to miss so many rides and shows. Not all of us can afford the Express Pass! And not all of us can ride the same thing together. If this tool is a mess then our experience is a mess! This is bad especially when on some ride, carrying a mobile phone inside the queue is strictly prohibited so we had no way to communicate with our party when we are queuing, We can’t tell non-rider if we’re going to be early or late or when we’ll finish our ride to come meet them.
 
2- Rude, unhappy, unsympathetic, unwelcoming staff. I have nothing against their accents but I believe a soft tone, couple smiles and a couple of  ""sir/mam"" would not reduce the efficiency of the service.  Aggressive hand gesture from staffs is also not acceptable. Being kind and sympathetic when telling off guests who want more picture time with their favorite characters when there’s no more time available is also a nice thing they should do. 

I saw that some of the guests here can be very rude too and dealing with them accordingly is nice but please don't leave other guests traumatized for having witnessed indecencies. Apologize to other good customers for what happened is a good enough way to go. I don’t know if it’s the cultural thing but I think staff members need to be better trained.
 
3- Security measures for Battlestar Galactica has totally destroyed my ride/park experience. I do understand that safety operation is the top concern for a theme park especially one with top roller coasters. I agree with checking/restricting all the metals and loose articles is a must for major roller coasters up until I was told off by the gate staff that I was not allowed to carry my banknotes in my pocket onto the roller coaster, yes, paper banknotes! I had already put my mobile phone, coins, wallets with money and credit cards inside the lockers available. The lockers which said ""free rental for 48 minutes"" after the free rental time runs out, 2 dollars will be charged to reopen the locker. If I don't take a few banknotes with me, how else am I going to open the locker when free rental period runs out? Especially when I can’t know how long I will be inside the ride for? That gate staff was so rude to me (and other guests apparently) I demanded some explanation to why I can’t carry banknotes with me and she just gave me a short rude ""No"" as her answer.  That is not the way to treat your paying guests, Universal Studio Singapore. And again, since there’s no mobile phone allowed in the queue, what are we supposed to do in those long boring hours? 

The dispatching of the train was also awfully slow, I don’t understand why every previous rider has to be cleared out of the station before ride operator can launch the next train especially when there is already a gated area inside the exitting platform just before the exit door which I believe is the area designed for riders who have completed their ride to wait for their remaining party from the later train to join them before exiting the station “together” just like how they come in. “No wait here” I was told by an impolite staff while waving her hands at me. Is there any explanation to this? 

Queue line operation was horrible. Express Pass was not express at all. Each of us had unilimited express pass, once on a Cylon coaster (23/5/17) It was a 40 minute wait for non express pass rider mean while it was about 25 minute wait for us. I have never seen an express line filled up like that before even at Cedar Point on a peek summer day. And on the Mummy coaster, we stood in front of the express boarding gate looking at 3 trains leaving without us, why is that? 

The Battlestar rollercoasters are not reliable, On our last visits, each of the coaster broke down “at least” twice throughout the day. Each downtime will waste about one hour before the service can resume. We saw empty trains test-running more times than we saw a fully loaded train. And you don’t offer any kind of notification and compensation to Express Pass holders or any guests for that matter. We paid for expensive tickets, paid extra dollars to get extra ride-time and we got nothing but disappointment. Safety is very important, understand that. But when rides break down this often, a compensation will turn around the situation. 

4- Inefficient cash register at Transformer souvenir shop. I queued to pay for the toys for over 10 minutes, there were a few customers in front of me, having to queue long time in a busy shop to wait for your turn to pay is ok too. But 3 staff members behind just “one” out of the 3 cash registers while the other two machines turned off is just “not” OK. How could this happen?

5- Overpriced. From tickets to number of attractions to F&B. Paying that much will not be a problem if the service can keep up. 

6- Short operating park hour. With all the mess created by the queue time indicator and rides’ unreliability, I wish we’d had a bit more time to spend at the park. But I don’t think there will be another time for me any more, not after all of this horrible experience. 

Universal Studios is a great global brand for amusement parks and Universal Studios Singapore has some of the world’s best products available but the staff and service have failed to deliver up to the world-class standards. I hope this gets fixed.","Sadly, Never Again",2017-05-01,FAMILY,Ekkasit J,"Bangkok, Thailand",Bangkok,Thailand,-1
0,487251302,2017-05-24,OTHER,4,"If you are looking for an adrenaline rush, Malaysia (genting or sunway) or Thailand would be the best option. Both the thrill and the cost effectiveness would be much higher. 

USS is good in its own way where the rides are movie based and all. Loved the Battlestar galactica, Transformers and Jurrasic park rides. Others were more or less normal rides as per my view. 

Do not carry a lot of things because in some rides you have to keep away the loose items. They have lockers, but for a limited time. Food inside the USS is expensive. Hence if possible come out, have lunch and go back in. 

It will take a full day to enjoy all the items given the amount of people who visit USS on that day.

One point to remember is that there are four rides which are not covered in the express pass. The rationale for choosing Saturday is the parade happens only that day of the week. Also check for the fireworks and stay on till 8 pm. Do the rides and do catch the street show of Madagascar and rockerfellas. The stunt show is a must see too.
